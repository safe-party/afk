Of course. Here is the comprehensive study guide on the Multiple Choice Questions from the Day 2 lecture transcript, formatted for your review.

### Question 2:

A six-year-old patient presents with pain from tooth #85. Clinical and radiographic examination reveals deep caries with pulp exposure. During pulpotomy, bleeding from the radicular pulp is uncontrolled. Tooth #84 has extensive caries and is non-restorable. Which of the following is the most significant treatment for tooth #84 and #85?

*   A. Pulpectomy of tooth #85 with composite restoration. Extract tooth #84 and place a band and loop space maintainer.
*   B. Pulpotomy on tooth #85 with stainless steel crown. Extract tooth #84 and place a crown and loop space maintainer.
*   C. Extract both #84 and #85 and place a lingual arch space maintainer.
*   **D. Perform pulpectomy on tooth #85 with a stainless steel crown. Extract tooth #84 and place a crown and loop space maintainer.**

**Explanation:**

*   **Tooth #85:** The initial plan may have been a pulpotomy, but the fact that bleeding from the radicular pulp is uncontrolled is a definitive sign of irreversible pulpitis extending into the root. This contraindicates a pulpotomy and makes a **pulpectomy** the required treatment. The ideal restoration after endodontic treatment on a primary molar is a **stainless steel crown (SSC)** for durability.
*   **Tooth #84:** This tooth is non-restorable and requires **extraction**.
*   **Space Maintenance:** Since the patient is only six, the extraction of #84 will lead to space loss. A space maintainer is required. Since an SSC is being placed on #85, the ideal space maintainer is a **crown and loop**, where the loop is soldered directly to the crown on #85 to hold the space for #84.
*   **Option B is incorrect** because a pulpotomy is not indicated due to the uncontrolled bleeding.

### Question 3:

A 57-year-old male patient presents for root canal treatment of an asymptomatic mandibular molar. The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c of 10%. After local anesthesia is administered, the patient becomes diaphoretic and pale. Shortly after, the patient loses consciousness. Which of the following medications is the most suitable for the management of this emergency?

*   A. Epinephrine
*   B. Insulin
*   C. Oral glucose
*   **D. Intravenous glucagon**

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The patient's signs and symptoms (diaphoresis/sweating, pallor, rapid loss of consciousness) are classic for **hypoglycemia** (low blood sugar). Even with a high HbA1c (indicating poor long-term control), acute hypoglycemic events are a common and dangerous complication. Hypoglycemia has a rapid onset, whereas hyperglycemia develops more slowly.
*   **Management:** The treatment for hypoglycemia is to administer sugar. However, the patient has lost consciousness, making it unsafe to administer anything orally (like oral glucose or juice) due to the risk of aspiration.
*   **Correct Action:** In an unconscious hypoglycemic patient, the correct management is to administer **intravenous (or intramuscular) glucagon**. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release stored glucose, rapidly raising blood sugar levels.

### Question 4:

What is the main disadvantage of using bioceramic sealers during obturation?

*   A. High risk of tissue irritation in case of extrusion of the sealer.
*   B. Low flowability of the sealer results in increased voids within the obturation.
*   C. Bioceramic sealers have a slow setting reaction.
*   D. Bioceramic sealers do not adhere to the dentinal wall of the root canal.
*   **E. Bioceramic sealers increase the difficulty of endodontic retreatment.**

**Explanation:**

*   Bioceramic sealers have many advantages: they are highly biocompatible (A is false), have excellent flow (B is false), are adhesive (D is false), and have a slow setting time which is an advantage, not a disadvantage (C is false).
*   The primary drawback is that once they set, they become very hard. This hardness makes them difficult to remove from the canal if endodontic retreatment becomes necessary in the future.

### Question 5:

A patient's medical history is significant for epilepsy, for which he takes carbamazepine. In case of an odontogenic infection, which of the following antibiotics is contraindicated?

*   A. Amoxicillin
*   B. Penicillin
*   C. Azithromycin
*   **D. Clarithromycin**

**Explanation:**

*   There is a significant drug interaction between **carbamazepine** and certain macrolide antibiotics, specifically **clarithromycin** and **erythromycin**.
*   These macrolides inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine, leading to increased, potentially toxic levels of carbamazepine in the blood. This can result in side effects like ataxia, vertigo, and drowsiness.
*   Azithromycin is also a macrolide but does not typically cause this interaction. Therefore, clarithromycin should be avoided in a patient taking carbamazepine.

### Question 6:

An adult patient is to undergo orthodontic treatment to correct retruded mandibular incisors, which show healthy gingival condition and minimal width of attached gingiva and a shallow labial vestibule. Which of the following periodontal surgeries is required prior to orthodontic treatment?

*   A. Laterally positioned flap graft
*   **B. Free gingival graft**
*   C. Guided tissue regeneration
*   D. Subepithelial connective tissue graft
*   E. No periodontal procedure is required prior to orthodontic treatment.

**Explanation:**

*   The patient has two key risk factors for gingival recession: (1) a minimal width of attached gingiva and (2) a planned orthodontic movement (protrusion of the incisors) that will push the roots labially, further thinning the buccal plate of bone.
*   To prevent recession from occurring during treatment, it is necessary to augment the gingival tissue *before* starting orthodontics.
*   A **free gingival graft** is the most predictable procedure for increasing the width and thickness of attached keratinized gingiva in the mandibular anterior region. A subepithelial connective tissue graft is used primarily for root coverage, not for creating new attached gingiva where none exists.

### Question 7:

If a rotary endodontic instrument has a progressively increasing taper from the tip of the instrument to the coronal aspect, this instrument will:

*   **A. Enlarge the canal mainly in the coronal third.**
*   B. Enlarge the canal mainly in the apical third.
*   C. Enlarge the canal mainly in the middle third.
*   D. Enlarge the canal equally in all thirds.

**Explanation:**

*   A **progressively increasing taper** means the instrument's diameter increases more rapidly as you move from the tip towards the handle. For example, the taper might be 2% at the tip but 8% near the coronal end.
*   This design concentrates the cutting action in the wider, more tapered sections of the instrument.
*   Therefore, an instrument with a progressive taper is designed to primarily shape and enlarge the **coronal and middle thirds** of the root canal, consistent with a crown-down preparation philosophy. Instruments designed for apical finishing often have a regressive taper (larger taper at the tip).

### Question 8:

During the try-in of an all-ceramic crown, what is the most appropriate way to check for the presence or absence of occlusal contact with the opposing tooth?

*   A. Articulating paper
*   **B. Shim stock**
*   C. Wax
*   D. Additional silicone

**Explanation:**

*   There is a critical difference between checking for the *presence* of a contact versus its *location*.
*   **Shim Stock:** This is an extremely thin (approx. 8 microns) metal foil. It is the most reliable indicator for confirming the **presence or absence** of a contact. If the shim stock holds when the patient bites, there is contact. If it pulls through without resistance, there is no contact.
*   **Articulating Paper:** This is much thicker (40-100+ microns). It is used to identify the **location** of contacts by leaving a colored mark. However, its thickness can create a false positive; it may feel like there is contact when there isn't one, simply due to the paper's bulk. Therefore, for initial confirmation of contact, shim stock is superior.

### Question 9:

In group-guided occlusion, which of the following best describes the posterior occlusal contact pattern during lateral excursion?

*   **A. Posterior teeth are in contact during lateral excursions on the working side only.**
*   B. Posterior teeth are in contact during lateral excursion on the working and non-working sides.
*   C. No contact between the posterior teeth on both the working and the non-working side.
*   D. No contact between posterior teeth on the working side, but there is contact on the non-working side.

**Explanation:**

*   **Group Function (Group-Guided) Occlusion:** During a lateral excursive movement, the guidance is shared among a group of teeth on the **working side**. This typically includes the canine and the posterior teeth (premolars and sometimes the mesiobuccal cusp of the first molar). There are no contacts on the non-working (balancing) side.
*   **Canine Guidance:** All posterior teeth on both the working and non-working sides are discluded immediately by the canines.
*   **Balanced Occlusion:** There are simultaneous contacts on both the working and non-working sides. This is typically used for complete dentures.

### Question 10:

Which of the following irrigation agents minimizes the risk of accidental fracture of rotary instruments?

*   **A. Sodium hypochlorite**
*   B. Hydrogen peroxide
*   C. Calcium hydroxide
*   D. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)

**Explanation:**

*   The key to minimizing fracture risk from torque and friction is **lubrication**.
*   While EDTA is a chelating agent that softens dentin, its action is too slow to provide effective lubrication during active instrumentation. The file cuts the dentin before the EDTA has time to soften it.
*   The most effective lubricant is a thin, **aqueous solution** that can continuously flow around the instrument. Standard **sodium hypochlorite** solution provides excellent lubrication, reducing the torque generated on the file during rotation and thus lowering the risk of cyclic fatigue and fracture. Paste-based lubricants are less effective than aqueous solutions for this purpose.

### Question 11:

A patient presents to your clinic complaining of white spot lesions on maxillary incisors. The patient has just had their orthodontic braces removed. According to the ICDAS, these tooth surfaces are given which of the following codes?

*   A. Code 0
*   B. Code 1
*   **C. Code 2**
*   D. Code 3

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** White spot lesions that appear around orthodontic brackets are a result of demineralization due to plaque accumulation. They are the earliest visible stage of a carious lesion.
*   **ICDAS Codes for Non-Cavitated Lesions:**
    *   **Code 0:** Sound tooth surface.
    *   **Code 1:** First visual change in enamel (white or brown spot) that is only visible **after prolonged air drying**.
    *   **Code 2:** Distinct visual change in enamel (white or brown spot) that is clearly visible when the tooth is **wet**.
*   Since these post-orthodontic white spots are distinct and visible to the patient without special drying, they are classified as **Code 2**. Code 3 would involve a microcavitation or initial breakdown of the enamel surface.

### Question 12:

Cephalometric analysis reveals an increased interincisal angle. Clinically, the patient will have:

*   A. Reduced overjet and reduced overbite
*   B. Increased overjet and increased overbite
*   C. Increased overjet and reduced overbite
*   **D. Reduced overjet and increased overbite**

**Explanation:**

*   The interincisal angle is the angle formed by the long axes of the maxillary and mandibular incisors.
*   **Increased Interincisal Angle:** This means the incisors are more upright or even retroclined. When the maxillary incisor is more upright, it moves posteriorly, which **reduces the horizontal overlap (overjet)**. At the same time, this upright position causes a greater **vertical overlap (increased overbite)**, leading to a deep bite.
*   **Decreased Interincisal Angle:** This means the incisors are more proclined or flared out. This **increases the overjet** but **reduces the overbite**, leading to a shallow bite or open bite tendency.

### Question 13:

In a study on occupational exposure and cancer risk, participants who were diagnosed with cancer are more likely to remember past exposures. Which of the following biases is most likely to occur?

*   A. Sampling bias
*   B. Selection bias
*   **C. Recall bias**
*   D. Conforming bias

**Explanation:**

*   **Recall Bias:** This is a systematic error that occurs in case-control studies when there are differences in the accuracy or completeness of recollections of past events or exposures between the "cases" (those with the disease) and the "controls" (those without).
*   Individuals who have developed a disease (like cancer) are often motivated to think deeply about past exposures that may have caused it, leading to a more detailed memory than healthy individuals, who have no such motivation. This differential recall can skew the results and create a false association.

### Question 14:

What is the most likely diagnosis of a non-corticated, dome-shaped radiopacity in the maxillary sinus?

*   **A. Maxillary sinus retention cyst (Antral pseudocyst)**
*   B. Maxillary sinusitis
*   C. Malignancy affecting the maxillary sinus
*   D. Foreign body in the maxillary sinus
*   E. Periapical infection of a maxillary molar

**Explanation:**

*   The "dome-shaped, non-corticated radiopacity" arising from the floor of the maxillary sinus is the classic radiographic description of an **antral pseudocyst**, also known as a maxillary sinus retention cyst. It is a common, asymptomatic, incidental finding.
*   **Key Differentiator:** The lack of cortication is crucial. A periapical infection from a maxillary molar can also create a dome-shaped opacity as it pushes the sinus floor upwards, but this opacity will be **corticated** (it is the bony floor of the sinus itself). Malignancy would show destruction of the sinus floor, not a smooth dome. Sinusitis presents as a diffuse thickening of the entire sinus lining.

### Question 15:

In orthodontic therapy using fixed appliances, what is the function of large rectangular stainless steel wires?

*   A. Derotating the teeth
*   **B. Torquing of the roots**
*   C. Tipping teeth in a mesial-distal direction
*   D. Moving the teeth in a buccal-lingual direction

**Explanation:**

*   Orthodontic treatment progresses from small, flexible round wires to larger, stiffer rectangular wires.
*   **Initial Wires (Small, Round):** Used for leveling, aligning, and derotating teeth. They engage the bracket slot loosely and are good for tipping movements.
*   **Finishing Wires (Large, Rectangular, Stainless Steel):** These wires fully engage the rectangular slot of the bracket. This full engagement allows the wire to exert a moment or a "couple," which is necessary to produce **torque**. Torque is the buccolingual movement of the root, which is essential for achieving proper root angulation and finishing the case.

### Question 16:

Following phase one periodontal therapy, a patient returned to the clinic eight weeks later for periodontal re-evaluation. The patient has optimal oral health with the exception of a residual pocket and bleeding on probing only on the mesial aspect of tooth #34. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Administer 20 mg of sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD)
*   **B. Administer a local antibiotic to the mesial aspect of tooth #34.**
*   C. Prescribe 100 mg of systemic doxycycline.
*   D. Repeat non-surgical debridement therapy.

**Explanation:**

*   The patient has responded well to initial therapy everywhere except for one specific, localized site. This makes it a localized problem that calls for a localized solution.
*   **Locally Delivered Antibiotics (LDAs):** Products like Arestin (minocycline microspheres) or PerioChip (chlorhexidine chip) are designed for exactly this scenario. They are placed directly into the residual pocket to deliver a high concentration of an antimicrobial agent to eliminate the persistent bacteria.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Systemic Antibiotics (C) or SDD (A):** These are systemic treatments and are overkill for a single localized problem.
    *   **Repeating Debridement (D):** While often done in conjunction with LDAs, it's unlikely to solve the problem on its own if it failed the first time. The LDA is the key adjunctive therapy here.

### Question 17:

A 51-year-old female patient presents to the clinic complaining of severe pain in a lower tooth when drinking cold water and eating on the left side. The patient has a removable partial denture in the mandible. Tooth #34 has deep caries extending subgingivally close to the alveolar crest. The patient's medical history is significant for a metastatic bone cancer for which she is taking zoledronate. What is the most appropriate treatment plan?

*   A. Caries excavation and composite buildup of tooth #34.
*   B. Extraction of tooth #34 and adding an acrylic tooth to the denture to replace it.
*   C. Root canal treatment of tooth #34 followed by crown lengthening and crown placement.
*   **D. Root canal treatment of tooth #34 followed by coronectomy and adding an acrylic tooth to the denture to replace it.**

**Explanation:**

*   **The Problem:** The patient is taking zoledronate, an intravenous bisphosphonate, which carries a high risk of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ). Therefore, any procedure involving bone manipulation (extraction, crown lengthening) must be avoided if possible.
*   **Analyzing the Options:**
    *   Options B (extraction) and C (crown lengthening) involve surgery and bone manipulation and are thus contraindicated.
    *   Option A (composite buildup) is not feasible as the tooth is unrestorable without crown lengthening and requires endodontic treatment due to the severe pain.
*   **The Best (Most Conservative) Option:** Option D provides the safest course of action.
    1.  **Root Canal Treatment:** This eliminates the pain and infection from the pulp.
    2.  **Coronectomy:** Removing the crown down to the gum level eliminates the non-restorable portion of the tooth without disturbing the root or surrounding bone.
    3.  **Adding a Denture Tooth:** This provides an aesthetic and functional replacement without any surgery.
*   This approach manages the patient's acute problem while completely avoiding the risk of triggering MRONJ.

### Question 18:

Which of the following conditions is associated with short roots and periapical radiolucencies?

*   **A. Dentin dysplasia type I**
*   B. Dentin dysplasia type II
*   C. Dentinogenesis imperfecta
*   D. Amelogenesis imperfecta

**Explanation:**

*   **Dentin Dysplasia Type I (Radicular Type):** This is the condition classically described as "rootless teeth." It is characterized by teeth with normal-appearing crowns but extremely short, blunted, or conical roots. Due to the defective root structure, these teeth are prone to mobility and often develop multiple periapical radiolucencies (cysts or granulomas) without an obvious cause like caries.
*   **Dentin Dysplasia Type II (Coronal Type):** Affects the pulp chambers ("thistle-tube" appearance), but root length is normal.
*   **Dentinogenesis Imperfecta:** Features bulbous crowns, cervical constriction, and obliterated pulp canals, but not characteristically short roots.

### Question 19:

Which of the following is LEAST likely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)?

*   A. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
*   B. Nasopharyngeal cancer
*   **C. Gastric cancer**
*   D. Burkitt's lymphoma

**Explanation:**

*   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus strongly linked to several malignancies.
*   **Strong Associations:**
    *   **Burkitt's Lymphoma:** Particularly the endemic African type.
    *   **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma:** Especially common in Southern China.
    *   **Hodgkin's Lymphoma:** A subset of cases.
    *   **Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas:** Especially in immunocompromised individuals.
*   **Gastric Cancer:** While EBV can be found in a small percentage (around 10%) of gastric adenocarcinomas, the association is much weaker and less established compared to the other lymphomas and nasopharyngeal cancer. Therefore, it is the *least likely* to be associated among the given options.

### Question 20:

If an implant is placed to restore a missing central incisor in a 14-year-old patient, which of the following is expected to take place after ten years?

*   A. Supra-occlusion
*   **B. Infra-occlusion**
*   C. Severe ridge resorption
*   D. No significant change

**Explanation:**

*   Placing an implant in a growing patient is contraindicated for this very reason.
*   An implant, once osseointegrated, becomes ankylosed to the bone and does not move.
*   The adjacent natural teeth, however, continue to erupt and drift along with the vertical and horizontal growth of the alveolar bone, which continues into the late teens and even early twenties.
*   Over time, the adjacent natural teeth will continue to erupt inferiorly, while the implant remains fixed in its original position. This will make the implant crown appear short and submerged relative to the adjacent teeth, a state known as **infra-occlusion**.

### Question 21:

A 50-year-old male with controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c is 6.8%) and a 15-year history of smoking one pack per day presents for a consultation regarding implant placement in the mandibular left molar region. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed 10 mm of bone height above the inferior alveolar canal and 6 mm of bone width. What is the most appropriate course of action?

*   A. Defer implant treatment until the patient stops smoking and the HbA1c falls below 6%.
*   **B. Proceed with implant placement using the standard implant protocol and inform the patient of the increased risk of implant failure.**
*   C. Perform a ridge augmentation procedure prior to implant placement.
*   D. Refer the patient for hyperbaric oxygen therapy prior to surgery.
*   E. Reject implant placement and recommend a removable partial denture.

**Explanation:**

*   **Assessing Contraindications:**
    *   **Diabetes:** The patient's diabetes is **well-controlled** (HbA1c < 7.0%), which is not a contraindication to implant surgery.
    *   **Smoking:** Smoking is a significant risk factor that decreases implant success rates, but it is a **relative contraindication**, not an absolute one.
    *   **Bone Volume:** The available bone (10mm height, 6mm width) is sufficient for placing a standard implant without needing augmentation.
*   **Appropriate Action:** Since there are no absolute contraindications, it is appropriate to **proceed with implant placement**. However, it is ethically and legally mandatory to have a thorough discussion with the patient, informing them that their smoking habit significantly increases the risk of complications and implant failure.

### Question 22:

Which of the following statements regarding the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is FALSE?

*   **A. It plays a key role in neutrophil and other immune cell recruitment to the site of inflammation.**
*   B. It induces the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
*   C. It contributes significantly to alveolar bone loss in periodontitis.
*   D. It can be inhibited by the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

**Explanation:**

*   PGE2 is a potent pro-inflammatory mediator in periodontal disease.
*   **Its True Roles:**
    *   It **induces the production of MMPs**, which are enzymes that degrade collagen and other connective tissues (Statement B is true).
    *   It directly stimulates osteoclasts, leading to **alveolar bone resorption** (Statement C is true).
    *   As a prostaglandin, its synthesis is blocked by **NSAIDs** (Statement D is true).
*   **Its False Role:** The recruitment of immune cells like neutrophils to the site of inflammation is the primary role of **chemokines** (e.g., IL-8), not prostaglandins. Therefore, statement A is false.

### Question 23:

A 21-year-old female patient presents with a complaint of gradual facial asymmetry over the past two years. A panoramic radiograph reveals a diffusely opaque lesion in the right maxilla. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum calcium, and alkaline phosphatase, are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

*   **A. Fibrous dysplasia**
*   B. Ossifying fibroma
*   C. Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis
*   D. Paget's disease of the bone

**Explanation:**

*   This presentation is classic for monostotic **fibrous dysplasia**.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Age:** Develops in younger patients (children and young adults).
    *   **Location/Symmetry:** Typically **unilateral** and common in the maxilla, causing gradual, painless expansion.
    *   **Radiographic Appearance:** Presents as a **diffuse**, ill-defined lesion with a characteristic **"ground-glass"** opacity.
    *   **Lab Tests:** Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase are typically **normal**.
*   **Differentiating from Others:**
    *   **Paget's Disease:** Affects older patients, is often bilateral or polyostotic, and shows elevated alkaline phosphatase.
    *   **Ossifying Fibroma:** Is a well-defined, encapsulated lesion, not diffuse.
    *   **Osteomyelitis:** Is an infection and would present with pain, fever, and other signs of inflammation.

### Question 24:

A patient presents to your clinic for dental examination. You notice that his lower lip is dry and scaly with some areas of ulceration. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   **A. Incisional biopsy**
*   B. Excisional biopsy
*   C. Intralesional corticosteroids
*   D. Topical antimicrobial ointment

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The description of a dry, scaly lower lip with areas of ulceration in a sun-exposed area is highly suggestive of **actinic cheilitis**.
*   **Nature of the Lesion:** Actinic cheilitis is a pre-malignant condition that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of **ulceration**, induration, or thickening are clinical signs that raise suspicion of malignant transformation.
*   **Management:** Because of the risk of malignancy, any suspicious area within the actinic cheilitis (especially an ulcerated area) **must be biopsied**. An **incisional biopsy** is the correct procedure to obtain a representative tissue sample for histopathological diagnosis to rule out or confirm carcinoma.

### Question 25:

Which of the following statements is true concerning cellular intrinsic fiber cementum?

*   A. It plays an important role in tooth attachment.
*   B. It covers the coronal half of the root.
*   C. Its intrinsic fibers run perpendicular to the root surface.
*   D. Its intrinsic fibers have larger diameters compared to extrinsic fibers.
*   **E. A thin and unmineralized layer of organic matrix is commonly evident on its outer layer.**

**Explanation:**

*   **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Fibers:**
    *   **Extrinsic fibers** are the Sharpey's fibers from the PDL that insert *into* the cementum perpendicularly to provide tooth attachment.
    *   **Intrinsic fibers** are produced by cementoblasts and are part of the cementum matrix itself. They run *parallel* to the root surface and do not contribute to attachment.
*   **Cellular Intrinsic Fiber Cementum (CIFC):** This type of cementum is involved in repair and adaptation. It is found in apical and furcation areas.
*   **Cementoid Layer:** The outer surface of actively forming cementum, including CIFC, is covered by a thin, unmineralized organic matrix called **cementoid**. This is analogous to the osteoid layer on bone. Therefore, statement E is correct.

### Question 26:

During the final steps of irrigation of the root canal treatment of tooth #14, the patient suddenly experienced severe pain and a swelling developed on the labial vestibule of #14. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Seal the tooth using MTA.
*   **B. Irrigate the canal with a large amount of saline.**
*   C. Inject non-setting calcium hydroxide into the canal and temporize the tooth.
*   D. Extract the tooth.

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The sudden onset of severe pain and rapid swelling during irrigation is the classic presentation of a **sodium hypochlorite accident**, where the irrigant has been extruded past the apex into the periapical tissues.
*   **Immediate Management:** The first and most critical step is to immediately attempt to dilute and flush out the caustic hypochlorite from the tissues. This is achieved by **irrigating the canal with a large volume of sterile saline**. This helps to neutralize the irrigant and reduce the severity of the subsequent tissue necrosis and inflammation. After irrigation, analgesics and antibiotics are prescribed, and the patient is monitored.

### Question 27:

A patient presents for cementation of a CAD/CAM restoration. The restoration is unstable in the patient's mouth but stable on the cast. Which of the following is the most likely reason?

*   **A. Inaccurate digital impression**
*   B. Sharp line angles in the tooth preparation
*   C. Undercuts in the tooth preparation
*   D. Open proximal contacts in the provisional restoration

**Explanation:**

*   The core of the problem is a **discrepancy between the model and the actual tooth**. If the restoration fits the model perfectly but not the tooth, it means the model is not an accurate replica of the tooth.
*   The model is generated from the digital scan. Therefore, an error in the scan – an **inaccurate digital impression** where part of the preparation was not captured correctly – is the only logical cause.
*   **Other Options:**
    *   **Sharp line angles** would cause overmilling, and the crown would be loose on *both* the model and the tooth.
    *   **Open contacts in the provisional** would cause adjacent teeth to drift, resulting in tight proximal contacts on the final crown, preventing it from seating fully.

### Question 28:

While preparing the middle third of the mesiobuccal canal of tooth #36 during root canal treatment, the working length could no longer be reached. Which of the following is the most likely reason?

*   A. The dentist did not recapitulate after every file.
*   B. The dentist did not irrigate after every file.
*   **C. A ledge was accidentally created within the canal.**
*   D. The file separated in the canal.

**Explanation:**

*   Loss of working length can be caused by debris packing in the apical third (due to lack of irrigation/recapitulation) or by iatrogenic errors.
*   The key detail here is that the blockage occurred in the **middle third** of the canal.
*   Packing of dentinal debris (from options A and B) almost always occurs in the **apical third**.
*   A **ledge** is an artificial irregularity created on the canal wall, typically at the point of a curvature. If the canal has a curvature in its middle third, it is highly likely that an instrument has created a ledge, which is now preventing subsequent files from advancing past that point to the apex.

### Question 29:

What is the crown height space needed for an implant-retained removable partial denture?

*   A. Less than 8 mm
*   B. 8-12 mm
*   **C. More than 12 mm**
*   D. The crown height space does not differ based on the prosthesis type.

**Explanation:**

*   **Crown Height Space:** The vertical distance from the crest of the alveolar bone to the occlusal plane of the opposing teeth.
*   Different restorations require different amounts of vertical space.
*   **Implant-Retained Removable Dentures** require the *most* crown height space. This is because you must accommodate the height of the denture acrylic base, the denture teeth, and, most importantly, the attachment system (e.g., a bar, locators, ball abutments) that connects the denture to the implants.
*   The minimum required space is generally considered to be **more than 12 mm**. A fixed implant prosthesis typically requires 8-12 mm.

### Question 30:

A tooth has symptoms of pulpitis and a pulp exposure. Which of the following factors is most important in determining the treatment of choice?

*   A. Time since the pulp exposure occurred
*   B. The size of the pulp exposure
*   C. The type of the pulp exposure
*   **D. The amount of bleeding from the exposed pulp**

**Explanation:**

*   While all the factors listed can influence the prognosis, the most critical determinant of the immediate treatment plan is the status of the pulp tissue, which is assessed clinically by hemorrhage control.
*   The **amount of bleeding** from the pulp after exposure or amputation is a direct indicator of the extent of pulpal inflammation.
*   If hemostasis (the stopping of bleeding) can be achieved quickly and easily (e.g., within 5-10 minutes) after removing the coronal pulp, it suggests the remaining radicular pulp is healthy, and a pulpotomy is likely to succeed.
*   If bleeding is profuse and cannot be controlled, it indicates that the inflammation extends deep into the radicular pulp, and a pulpectomy (complete removal of the pulp) is necessary.

### Question 61:

An 18-year-old patient, previously diagnosed with necrotizing gingivitis, returns to the dental clinic six weeks after initial treatment, which included debridement, antibiotics, and improved oral hygiene. The patient reports no pain but expresses concern about the irregular and unaesthetic contour of the gingiva, particularly in the anterior region. On examination, there is no evidence of active infection or inflammation, but the gingival margins are uneven and cratered. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to address the patient's concern?

*   A. Observe and re-evaluate in 4-6 weeks.
*   B. Repeat debridement and re-evaluate in 4-6 weeks.
*   C. Instruct the patient to take a new course of antibiotics.
*   **D. Perform gingivectomy or gingivoplasty.**

**Explanation:**

*   Necrotizing periodontal diseases cause rapid tissue destruction, characteristically leading to "punched-out" or cratered interdental papillae and uneven gingival margins.
*   After the acute infection has resolved (as in this case), these architectural defects remain. The patient's concern is purely aesthetic and related to the poor contour of the healed gingiva.
*   **Gingivoplasty** is a surgical procedure specifically designed to reshape the gingiva to create a more physiological and aesthetic contour. Gingivectomy (excision of gingiva) may be part of this process. This is the correct procedure to address the patient's chief complaint.

### Question 62:

Which of the following may lead to apex locator reading errors?

*   A. External root resorption
*   B. Internal root resorption
*   **C. Calcified canals**
*   D. Pulp necrosis

**Explanation:**

*   Electronic apex locators work by measuring the difference in electrical impedance between the file in the canal and an electrode on the patient's lip.
*   **Calcified Canals:** A heavily calcified or blocked canal can impede the flow of the electrical current, preventing it from reaching the apex and completing the circuit properly. This can lead to erratic or inaccurate readings.
*   **Other Factors:**
    *   **Pulp Necrosis:** Does not affect accuracy.
    *   **External/Internal Resorption:** Studies have shown these do not significantly affect the accuracy of modern apex locators.
    *   **Other causes of errors:** Contact with metallic restorations, an open apex in an immature tooth, or severe hemorrhage/exudate in the canal.

### Question 63:

A 60-year-old patient presented to the clinic with a purple-red lesion on the hard palate. The patient mentioned that he was diagnosed with HIV two years ago. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this lesion?

*   **A. Antiretroviral therapy**
*   B. Intralesional corticosteroids
*   C. Surgical excision with 5 mm margins
*   D. Systemic antibiotic therapy

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** A purple-red lesion on the palate of an HIV-positive patient is classic for **Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)**, an AIDS-defining malignancy caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).
*   **Management:** While localized lesions can be treated with surgery or intralesional chemotherapy, the most significant and effective treatment for AIDS-related KS is systemic **Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)**.
*   **Mechanism:** HAART suppresses the HIV virus, which allows the patient's immune system (specifically their CD4 T-cell count) to recover. This restored immune function is then able to control the HHV-8 virus, often leading to the regression or complete resolution of the KS lesions without direct chemotherapy.

### Question 64:

For management of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, administration of systemic antivirals will produce resolution of symptoms if administered within:

*   A. The first day of symptoms
*   **B. The first three symptomatic days**
*   C. The first five symptomatic days
*   D. At any time during the course of the disease

**Explanation:**

*   Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is the initial infection with the Herpes Simplex Virus.
*   While treatment is often palliative (analgesics, fluids), systemic antiviral medication like acyclovir can shorten the duration and lessen the severity of the illness.
*   However, for the antiviral to be effective, it must be initiated early in the course of the infection while the virus is actively replicating. The clinical window of opportunity is within the **first 72 hours (three days)** of the onset of symptoms. After this period, the medication provides little to no benefit.

### Question 65:

A patient presents for orthodontic treatment. Intraoral and extraoral examination reveals a dental Class III malocclusion and crowding in the mandibular arch. In order to create space for tooth alignment, which teeth should be extracted?

*   **A. Mandibular first premolars**
*   B. Mandibular second premolars
*   C. Maxillary first premolars
*   D. Maxillary second premolars

**Explanation:**

*   The question asks for the extraction choice to specifically **create space for tooth alignment** due to crowding. The crowding is in the mandibular arch.
*   To relieve anterior crowding, the standard choice is to extract the **first premolars**. This places the extraction space closest to the area of crowding (incisors and canines), allowing for efficient retraction and alignment of these teeth.
*   Extracting the second premolars is typically done to facilitate mesialization of the molars (e.g., to correct a Class II molar relationship), not to resolve anterior crowding. Extracting maxillary teeth would not resolve crowding in the mandibular arch.

### Question 66:

During a pulpotomy procedure on tooth #84, an iatrogenic perforation was produced in the floor of the pulp chamber. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of tooth #84?

*   A. Immediate seal of the perforation
*   B. Delayed seal of the perforation
*   C. Immediate surgical repair of the perforation
*   **D. Extraction of tooth #84**

**Explanation:**

*   While a furcation perforation in a permanent tooth is often repaired with a material like MTA, the prognosis for repairing such a perforation in a **primary tooth** is very poor.
*   The area is difficult to seal effectively, and the process of physiologic root resorption can be disrupted, leading to chronic inflammation and potential damage to the developing permanent tooth bud underneath.
*   Therefore, the generally accepted standard of care when a furcation perforation occurs in a primary molar is **extraction** of the tooth.

### Question 67:

Radiographic examination of an implant revealed a 5 mm vertical bone defect on the mesial, with no mobility and no pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR)
*   **B. Guided bone regeneration (GBR)**
*   C. Continue with follow-up and do nothing.
*   D. Remove the implant as it is deemed a failed implant.

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** A vertical bone defect around an implant indicates peri-implantitis. Even though it is currently asymptomatic and not mobile, leaving it untreated will lead to progressive bone loss and eventual implant failure. Therefore, treatment is necessary.
*   **Treatment Goal:** The goal is to regenerate the lost bone in the defect. This is accomplished by raising a flap, debriding the implant surface, placing a bone graft material into the defect, and covering it with a barrier membrane.
*   **Terminology:** When this regenerative procedure is performed around a natural tooth to regenerate bone and PDL, it is called **Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR)**. When the same procedure is performed around a dental implant to regenerate only bone, it is called **Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR)**. Since this is an implant, GBR is the correct term and procedure.

### Question 68:

A researcher has discovered a new drug that is used to treat gingivitis. Which of the following parameters is the most important to deem this drug effective?

*   A. Decreased level of plaque
*   B. Decreased level of bacteria in the oral cavity
*   **C. Decreased level of gingival bleeding on probing**
*   D. Reduction in probing depths

**Explanation:**

*   The goal is to measure the clinical outcome of the disease being treated. Gingivitis is, by definition, inflammation of the gingiva.
*   The most objective and universally accepted clinical sign of gingival inflammation is **bleeding on probing (BOP)**.
*   Therefore, a significant reduction in BOP would be the primary endpoint and the most important parameter to demonstrate that the drug is effectively treating the gingivitis (i.e., reducing the inflammation). A reduction in plaque levels measures the cause, not the disease state itself. A reduction in probing depth is a measure for periodontitis, not gingivitis.

### Question 69:

Which of the following impression techniques is most accurate for an implant?

*   **A. Open tray implant level impression**
*   B. Closed tray implant level impression
*   C. Open tray abutment level impression
*   D. Closed tray abutment level impression

**Explanation:**

*   **Implant Level vs. Abutment Level:** An **implant-level** impression, where the impression coping attaches directly to the implant fixture, is more accurate than an abutment-level impression. It eliminates a potential source of error from an ill-fitting abutment.
*   **Open Tray vs. Closed Tray:** An **open-tray** impression is more accurate than a closed-tray impression. In an open-tray technique, the impression copings are unscrewed and remain locked inside the impression material when it is removed from the mouth. This eliminates the risk of error that occurs in the closed-tray technique when the clinician must manually remove the copings from the mouth and try to precisely reposition them back into the set impression material.
*   Combining these factors, the open tray, implant-level technique is the most accurate method.

### Question 70:

A 29-year-old patient presented to the clinic with multiple papules and pustules around the vermilion border of the upper and lower lips. The patient mentioned that the lesions have been present for the last two months. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Exfoliative cheilitis
*   **B. Perioral dermatitis**
*   C. Angular cheilitis
*   D. Recurrent herpes simplex

**Explanation:**

*   The description of multiple small **papules and pustules** in the perioral skin (around the mouth), often with a characteristic sparing of the area immediately adjacent to the vermilion border, is the classic clinical presentation of **perioral dermatitis**.
*   It is an inflammatory skin condition often triggered by topical steroids or heavy cosmetics.
*   The other conditions present differently: Exfoliative cheilitis is scaling and crusting of the lips themselves; Angular cheilitis is at the corners of the mouth; Recurrent herpes presents as localized vesicles that ulcerate.

### Question 71:

You are treating a patient with no significant medical history. During the appointment, the patient complains of a sudden severe pain in his chest. Which of the following is the most important emergency management consideration?

*   A. Administer oxygen and monitor the patient's vital signs.
*   B. Administer nitroglycerin and monitor the patient's vital signs.
*   C. Administer salbutamol and monitor the patient's vital signs.
*   **D. Activate emergency medical services.**

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Any **first-time occurrence of severe chest pain** in an adult must be treated as a **myocardial infarction (MI)** until proven otherwise.
*   **Management:** An MI is a life-threatening medical emergency. The single most important action and the absolute first priority is to **activate emergency medical services (call 911)** to get the patient to a hospital as quickly as possible.
*   While administering oxygen, nitroglycerin, and aspirin are all part of the MONA protocol for MI, none of these should delay activating the emergency response system.

### Question 72:

A maxillary complete denture is realigned, and during the delivery appointment, it is noted that the patient's face appears elongated and the maxillary incisors are showing excessive display. Which of the following is the most likely cause?

*   A. Excessive removal of acrylic from the fitting surface of the denture prior to the reline impression.
*   **B. Insufficient venting of the impression material during the impression-taking step.**
*   C. The dentist applied excessive pressure while seating the denture during the impression.
*   D. The insufficient viscosity of the impression material that was used during the impression-taking step.

**Explanation:**

*   **The Problem:** An elongated face and excessive incisor display are classic signs of an **increased vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO)**.
*   **The Cause:** This error occurred during the reline impression. An increased VDO means the denture was not fully seated on the residual ridge when the impression was made.
*   **Mechanism:** If the impression material cannot escape easily from under the denture, it becomes hydraulically trapped and prevents the denture from seating completely. This is why **insufficient venting** (not drilling escape holes in the denture) is a primary cause of this error. Insufficient pressure, using a high-viscosity material, or not removing enough acrylic could also cause this, but insufficient venting is a direct cause of the hydraulic pressure buildup.

### Question 73:

What is the mechanism of action of metformin?

*   **A. It reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis.**
*   B. It increases the sensitivity of target tissues to insulin.
*   C. It targets the beta cells in the pancreas to stimulate insulin release.
*   D. It decreases the absorption of saccharides in the intestine.

**Explanation:**

*   Metformin is a first-line oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class.
*   Its **primary mechanism of action** is to decrease the production of glucose by the liver, a process known as **hepatic gluconeogenesis**.
*   While it does have a minor effect on increasing the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues (Option B), its main effect is on the liver.
*   Option C describes sulfonylureas, and Option D describes alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.

### Question 74:

Which of the following types of bone grafts decreases the success rate of an implant surgery with sinus lifting?

*   **A. Block autograft**
*   B. Particulate autograft
*   C. Particulate allograft
*   D. Particulate xenograft

**Explanation:**

*   A sinus lift procedure involves augmenting the sinus floor to create vertical bone height. This requires a graft material that can be packed into the space and will be readily vascularized and remodeled into new bone.
*   **Particulate Grafts** (small granules of bone) are ideal for this. They have a large surface area, allowing for rapid invasion by blood vessels and bone-forming cells.
*   **Block Grafts** (solid blocks of cortical bone) are poorly suited for sinus augmentation. They are dense, have poor vascularity, and do not integrate well in this environment. They are more likely to become necrotic and fail, thus decreasing the success rate. Block grafts are better used for onlay grafting to provide structural support where needed.

### Question 75:

Tooth #14 has a 3 mm probing depth on the mesial and 4 mm of recession. What is the best oral hygiene method to clean this site?

*   **A. Interproximal brush**
*   B. Dental floss
*   C. Toothpick
*   D. Rubber tip

**Explanation:**

*   The patient has a total of 7 mm of clinical attachment loss (3 mm pocket + 4 mm recession) on the mesial of the maxillary first premolar.
*   This significant attachment loss results in a large, open interdental embrasure space (a "black triangle").
*   Furthermore, the maxillary first premolar has a distinct developmental concavity on its mesial root surface.
*   **Dental floss** is ineffective in these situations because it is a thin string that will span across the concavity and cannot adequately debride the root surface or fill the large embrasure.
*   An **interproximal brush** is the ideal tool. Its bristles can adapt to the root concavity and effectively clean the large surface area within the open embrasure.

### Question 76:

A seven-year-old patient presents with the permanent first molar erupting, but its mesial side is blocked under the primary second molar. Radiographic examination reveals resorption of the distal side of the primary second molar reaching the inner third of dentin. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Observation for three months
*   **B. Extraction of the primary second molar**
*   C. Surgical exposure of the mesial side of the permanent first molar
*   D. Placement of a Nance appliance

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** This is a case of **severe ectopic eruption** of the first permanent molar. The severity is indicated by the extensive resorption of the primary molar root.
*   **Management:** In severe cases where the permanent molar is significantly impacted and has caused irreversible damage to the primary molar, correction with an appliance is no longer feasible. The compromised primary second molar must be **extracted**.
*   **Next Step (Implied):** After extraction, there will be a significant space deficiency. The next step would be to implement a **space-regaining** appliance (e.g., a Nance with a spring, or a distalizing appliance) to push the permanent molar back into its correct position before the premolar erupts. Simple observation (A) or a passive Nance appliance (D) would allow the space loss to worsen.

### Question 77:

A healing abutment has been placed on an implant prior to restoration. The patient returns for his appointment two weeks later, and the gingiva has overgrown on top of the healing abutment. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Use a wider healing abutment.
*   **B. Use a longer healing abutment.**
*   C. Contour the bone.
*   D. Perform a gingivectomy on the mesial side.

**Explanation:**

*   The purpose of a healing abutment is to shape the soft tissue and keep it from growing over the top of the implant fixture.
*   If the gingiva has overgrown the abutment, it means the abutment that was placed was **too short** for the thickness of the patient's tissue.
*   The correct management is to remove the short healing abutment, remove the excess tissue if necessary, and place a **longer healing abutment** that extends at least 1-1.5 mm above the gingival margin. This will prevent the tissue from overgrowing it again. Using a wider abutment addresses a different issue (emergence profile) and would not solve the overgrowth problem.

### Question 78:

During the try-in of a posterior zirconia crown on tooth #46, it showed adequate marginal fit and was fully seated onto the prepared tooth, but no occlusal contact with the opposing tooth was observed. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the infraocclusion?

*   A. Debris present on the adjacent teeth during impression making.
*   B. Debris present on the surface of the crown preparation during impression taking.
*   **C. Debris present on the surface of the opposing tooth during the maxillary arch impression.**
*   D. The technician over-milled the occlusal surface of the crown.

**Explanation:**

*   **The Problem:** The crown is in infraocclusion, meaning it is too short.
*   **The Cause:** This error occurred during the fabrication steps. If there was debris (e.g., a piece of temporary cement) on the occlusal surface of the **opposing tooth** when the impression or scan was taken, the laboratory technician would fabricate the crown to occlude with that artificially high surface.
*   When the patient returns for the try-in, the debris is gone from the opposing tooth. Now, the crown, which was made to fit this "higher" opposing tooth, is too short and does not make contact. This results in infraocclusion.
*   Debris on the prepared tooth would prevent the crown from seating. Debris on adjacent teeth would affect proximal contacts.

### Question 79:

A 14-year-old patient requires retraction of the maxillary anterior segment following first premolar extractions. The orthodontist decides to place temporary anchorage devices (TADs) in the infrazygomatic crest to prevent mesial movement of the posterior teeth. This approach is an example of which type of anchorage?

*   A. Cortical anchorage
*   **B. Skeletal anchorage**
*   C. Reinforced anchorage
*   D. Reciprocal anchorage

**Explanation:**

*   **Anchorage** in orthodontics refers to resistance to unwanted tooth movement.
*   **Skeletal Anchorage:** This is a method that uses the bone itself as the anchor point, completely bypassing the teeth. Temporary anchorage devices (TADs), also known as mini-screws or mini-implants, are placed directly into the bone (like the infrazygomatic crest or the palate).
*   Forces are then applied from the TADs to the teeth that need to be moved. Because the TAD is osseointegrated and does not move, it provides **absolute anchorage**, allowing for tooth movement without any unwanted reciprocal movement of the anchor unit.

### Question 80:

Which of the following factors will increase the risk of cyclic fatigue failure in rotary endodontic instruments?

*   A. Uniform taper
*   **B. Increased depth of cutting flutes**
*   C. Small size
*   D. Low taper (e.g., 2%)

**Explanation:**

*   **Cyclic Fatigue** is the failure of a metal due to repeated cycles of tension and compression, which occurs when a file rotates within a curved canal.
*   **Increased Depth of Cutting Flutes:** Deeper flutes mean there is less solid metal in the cross-section of the instrument at any given point. This reduction in the cross-sectional diameter makes the instrument weaker and more susceptible to breaking from cyclic fatigue.
*   The other options decrease the risk of fracture:
    *   **Small size and low taper** make the instrument more flexible and resistant to fatigue.
    *   **Uniform taper** provides more even stress distribution compared to a variable taper.

### Question 81:

Which of the following groups of antibiotics demonstrate a bacteriostatic effect?

*   A. Carbapenems
*   **B. Macrolides**
*   C. Aminoglycosides
*   D. Cephalosporins

**Explanation:**

*   Antibiotics are classified as either bactericidal (they kill bacteria) or bacteriostatic (they inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction, allowing the host's immune system to clear the infection).
*   **Bacteriostatic:**
    *   **Macrolides** (e.g., Erythromycin, Clarithromycin, Azithromycin)
    *   Tetracyclines
    *   Clindamycin
    *   Sulfonamides
*   **Bactericidal:**
    *   Beta-lactams (Penicillins, **Cephalosporins, Carbapenems**)
    *   Vancomycin
    *   Metronidazole
    *   Fluoroquinolones
    *   **Aminoglycosides**

### Question 82:

When fabricating a removable partial denture, which of the following factors would indicate the use of a wrought wire clasp instead of a cast clasp?

*   A. A clasp on terminal abutment teeth in Kennedy Class I dentures.
*   B. A clasp on the distal abutment tooth in a Kennedy Class III denture.
*   C. A clasp on an abutment tooth with a shallow undercut.
*   **D. A clasp on an abutment tooth which has slight mobility and compromised periodontal attachment.**

**Explanation:**

*   The key difference between a wrought wire clasp and a cast clasp is **flexibility**. Wrought wire is much more flexible than cast metal.
*   A **cast clasp** is rigid and transmits significant stress to the abutment tooth during insertion and removal. This is detrimental to a tooth that is already periodontally compromised.
*   A **wrought wire clasp**, due to its flexibility, engages the undercut with much less force, reducing the stress transferred to a mobile or periodontally weak abutment tooth. It is also preferred for deep undercuts and in aesthetic zones.

### Question 83:

For pediatric patients, what is the appropriate dose and concentration of epinephrine to be administered in case of anaphylaxis using an EpiPen Jr.?

*   A. 0.3 mg of a 1:1000 solution
*   **B. 0.15 mg of a 1:2000 solution**
*   C. 0.5 mg of a 1:1000 solution
*   D. 0.15 mg of a 1:1000 solution

**Explanation:**

*   There are two standard autoinjector doses for epinephrine:
    *   **EpiPen (Adult):** Delivers **0.3 mg** of epinephrine in a **1:1000** concentration.
    *   **EpiPen Jr. (Pediatric):** Delivers **0.15 mg** (half the adult dose) of epinephrine in a **1:2000** concentration (half the adult concentration).
*   The EpiPen Jr. is intended for children weighing between 15 kg and 30 kg (33-66 lbs).

### Question 84:

Which of the following drugs has the lowest opioid agonist efficacy?

*   A. Codeine
*   **B. Pentazocine**
*   C. Methadone
*   D. Fentanyl

**Explanation:**

*   **Efficacy** refers to the maximum effect a drug can produce. Opioids are compared based on their ability to produce analgesia relative to morphine.
*   Codeine, Methadone, and Fentanyl are all **full agonists** at the mu-opioid receptor, meaning they produce a strong analgesic effect. Fentanyl is extremely potent.
*   **Pentazocine** is a **mixed agonist-antagonist**. It is an agonist at kappa receptors but a weak antagonist at mu receptors. This mixed profile results in a much lower maximal analgesic effect (lower efficacy) compared to full agonists and also creates a "ceiling effect" where increasing the dose does not increase the analgesia.

### Question 85:

During a dental appointment, your patient starts experiencing a sudden headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, and muscle weakness on the right side of his face. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Activate emergency medical services and administer nitroglycerin, aspirin, and oxygen.
*   **B. Activate emergency medical services and administer oxygen.**
*   C. Activate emergency medical services and administer epinephrine.
*   D. Administer oxygen and keep the patient under observation.

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The constellation of sudden neurological symptoms (headache, dizziness, visual changes, and unilateral facial weakness) is a classic presentation of a **cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or stroke**.
*   **Management:** A stroke is a time-critical medical emergency.
    1.  The absolute first priority is to **activate EMS (call 911)**.
    2.  The patient should be kept comfortable, and **oxygen can be administered** if they are hypoxic.
*   It is critical **NOT** to administer aspirin or any other anticoagulant (Option A) because you do not know if the stroke is ischemic (caused by a clot) or hemorrhagic (caused by a bleed). Giving aspirin during a hemorrhagic stroke would be catastrophic. This differentiation can only be made with a CT scan at the hospital.

### Question 86:

Which of the following types of root resorption may be associated with in-office internal bleaching?

*   A. Surface resorption
*   **B. External cervical resorption**
*   C. Apical resorption
*   D. Internal resorption

**Explanation:**

*   A known, though rare, complication of internal bleaching (both walking bleach and in-office techniques) is the development of **external cervical resorption**.
*   The theory is that the bleaching agent (hydrogen peroxide) can leak through patent dentinal tubules in the cervical area, below the CEJ, where the enamel is thin or absent. This leakage into the periodontal ligament space can trigger an inflammatory response that leads to clastic cells resorbing the external root surface in the cervical region. This is why placing a protective base over the gutta-percha at the level of the CEJ is a critical step in the internal bleaching procedure.

### Question 87:

Which of the following muscles will contribute most to the displacement of a mandibular complete denture in a patient who has severe alveolar ridge resorption?

*   A. Medial pterygoid muscle
*   B. Buccinator muscle
*   C. Masseter muscle
*   **D. Mylohyoid muscle**

**Explanation:**

*   As the mandibular ridge resorbs, the attachments of the muscles on the floor of the mouth become effectively higher and closer to the crest of the ridge.
*   The **mylohyoid muscle** forms the entire muscular floor of the mouth. When the patient swallows or lifts their tongue, the mylohyoid muscle contracts and elevates.
*   In a severely resorbed mandible, this upward movement of the muscle will directly lift and dislodge the lingual flange of the denture, making it the primary muscle responsible for instability. While the masseter can affect the distobuccal flange, the influence of the mylohyoid along the entire lingual border is more significant.

### Question 88:

A complete denture wearer presents to the clinic complaining that he recently started to feel pain under his upper complete denture. Examination reveals an ulcerated palatal torus. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   **A. Relieve the fitting surface of the upper denture.**
*   B. Surgical removal of the torus.
*   C. Surgical removal of the torus and fabrication of a new denture.
*   D. Incisional biopsy of the ulcer.

**Explanation:**

*   The problem is that the denture is putting excessive pressure on the thin mucosa covering the bony palatal torus, causing a pressure sore or ulcer.
*   The simplest, most conservative, and correct initial management is to **relieve the intaglio (fitting) surface of the denture** in the area that corresponds to the torus.
*   This can be done chairside using a pressure-indicating paste to identify the exact spot and an acrylic bur to gently grind away the denture base material. This eliminates the pressure point and allows the ulcer to heal. Surgical removal of the torus is a much more invasive option and is not the first line of treatment for a simple pressure spot.

### Question 89:

During orthodontic treatment of a young patient with rounded anterior teeth, a black triangle was observed in the midline. This could be due to:

*   A. The central incisors have a rectangular shape.
*   **B. Flaring of the roots of the central incisors.**
*   C. Excessive interproximal stripping of the central incisors.
*   D. Attachment loss due to periodontal disease.
*   E. The proximal contact between the central incisors is too gingival.

**Explanation:**

*   A "black triangle" is an open gingival embrasure space that appears when the interdental papilla does not fully fill the area below the contact point.
*   The position of the papilla is determined by the underlying bone and the position of the contact point. The further the contact point is from the bone crest, the more likely a black triangle will form.
*   **Flaring of the roots** means the roots are angled divergently away from each other, while the crowns are angled convergently toward each other. This pushes the **contact point very high up incisally**. This large distance between the incisal contact and the gingiva creates a large embrasure space that the papilla cannot fill, resulting in a black triangle. Rectangular teeth or a gingivally placed contact would do the opposite and reduce the embrasure space.

### Question 90:

A 17-year-old patient presents for follow-up six months after a luxation injury to his maxillary central incisor. Tooth mobility is normal, and the periapical radiograph shows calcific obliteration of the root canal space. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   **A. Keep the tooth under observation.**
*   B. Non-surgical endodontic treatment.
*   C. Apicectomy.
*   D. Partial pulpotomy.

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Calcific obliteration (or pulp canal obliteration) is a common response to dental trauma. It occurs when the pulp, in response to the injury, rapidly lays down reparative/tertiary dentin, which gradually fills up the pulp chamber and canal space.
*   **Sign of Vitality:** The fact that the tooth is forming new dentin is a definitive sign that the **pulp is vital**.
*   **Management:** As long as the tooth remains vital and asymptomatic and shows no signs of periapical pathology, **no treatment is indicated**. The tooth should simply be monitored periodically (e.g., annually) with pulp testing and radiographs. Endodontic treatment is only initiated if the tooth eventually becomes necrotic and develops a periapical lesion.

### Question 91:

A patient attends the clinic for crown preparation on tooth #36, which was endodontically treated six months ago. The patient mentions that she has occasional discomfort from that tooth when eating, and the tooth is tender to percussion. A periapical radiograph reveals acceptable obturation in the root canals and a radiolucency associated with the apex of the mesial root. What is the most appropriate next step?

*   A. Prescribe antibiotics for one week and follow-up.
*   B. Carry out crown preparation and restore with a temporary crown until the symptoms resolve.
*   **C. Take a cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan.**
*   D. Initiate endodontic retreatment.
*   E. Carry out an apicectomy.

**Explanation:**

*   **The Problem:** The patient has signs and symptoms of a failing root canal (tenderness to percussion, discomfort on biting, periapical radiolucency) six months after treatment.
*   **The Dilemma:** The cause of the failure is not apparent on the 2D periapical radiograph, which shows "acceptable obturation." This suggests a more complex issue, such as a missed canal (e.g., a mid-mesial canal), a vertical root fracture, or complex apical anatomy.
*   **The Next Step:** Before proceeding with any treatment (retreatment or surgery), the cause of the failure must be identified. A **cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan** provides a 3D view of the tooth and is the ideal diagnostic tool to identify these complex anatomical reasons for endodontic failure that are not visible on a conventional radiograph.

### Question 92:

Which of the following increases the bond strength in the hybrid layer in the one-step self-etching technique?

*   A. Treat the enamel with an abrasive prior to using the self-etching adhesive.
*   **B. Rub multiple layers of adhesive on the dentin.**
*   C. Apply phosphoric acid etch to the tooth.
*   D. Apply hydrofluoric acid etch to the tooth.

**Explanation:**

*   The question specifically asks how to improve the bond strength of the **hybrid layer**, which forms in the **dentin**.
*   One-step self-etch adhesives are known for creating a relatively thin hybrid layer.
*   Studies have shown that actively **rubbing or agitating multiple coats** of the adhesive onto the dentin surface improves the infiltration of the resin monomers into the demineralized collagen network. This creates a thicker, more robust, and better-quality hybrid layer, thus increasing the bond strength to dentin.
*   Applying phosphoric acid (Option C) improves the bond to *enamel* by creating deeper etch patterns, but it does not improve the hybrid layer in dentin; in fact, it can over-etch dentin if used improperly.

### Question 93:

Which of the following would classify a two-year-old patient as being at high risk for caries?

*   A. Primary caregiver with multiple restorations.
*   **B. Nocturnal breastfeeding.**
*   C. Increased lactobacilli count.
*   D. Consumption of 4 oz of juice per day.

**Explanation:**

*   The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) has caries risk assessment tools that identify key risk factors.
*   **Nocturnal Breastfeeding/Bottle-feeding:** Frequent, at-will breastfeeding or bottle-feeding at night after the eruption of teeth is a significant high-risk factor. During sleep, salivary flow decreases dramatically, so the milk (which contains sugars) pools around the teeth for prolonged periods, leading to aggressive early childhood caries.
*   The number of restorations in a caregiver is not a direct risk factor; *active caries* in the caregiver is. The frequency of sugar exposure is more important than the specific volume (Option D).

### Question 94:

Which of the following best characterizes the mechanical difference between uncontrolled tipping and bodily movement of a tooth during orthodontic treatment?

*   A. Uncontrolled tipping results in uniform displacement of the crown and root.
*   B. Bodily movement requires less force than tipping.
*   **C. Bodily movement involves translation of the crown and the root in the same direction and magnitude.**
*   D. Tipping generates forces primarily at the apex of the root.

**Explanation:**

*   **Tipping:** This is the simplest form of tooth movement, where a single force is applied to the crown. The tooth rotates around a center of resistance, causing the crown to move in one direction and the root apex to move in the opposite direction.
*   **Bodily Movement (Translation):** This is when the entire tooth—both the crown and the root—moves in the same direction by the same amount, without any tipping or rotation. It requires the application of both a force and a "couple" (a moment) to control the root position and is a much more complex and controlled movement than simple tipping.

### Question 95:

Which of the following best characterizes the histopathological appearance of Lichen Planus?

*   A. Non-keratinized epithelium with basal cell hyperplasia.
*   B. Acantholysis and intraepithelial clefting.
*   **C. A band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes at the epithelial-connective tissue interface.**
*   D. Granulomatous inflammation with Langerhans giant cells.

**Explanation:**

*   Oral Lichen Planus is a chronic inflammatory condition with a very characteristic microscopic appearance.
*   **Key Histopathological Features:**
    1.  Hyperkeratosis (which gives it the white appearance clinically).
    2.  Liquefactive degeneration of the basal cell layer of the epithelium.
    3.  A dense, **"band-like" infiltrate of T-lymphocytes** immediately beneath the epithelium, hugging the epithelial-connective tissue junction.
*   Acantholysis (loss of cohesion between epithelial cells) is the hallmark of pemphigus.

### Question 96:

A four-year-old patient presents with a unilateral posterior crossbite and midline deviation. On initial contact, an incisal interference is noticed between the right mandibular and maxillary primary canines, followed by a functional shift to the right into maximum intercuspation. Examination reveals that the maxillary arch width is adequate. What is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Maxillary expansion using a quad-helix appliance.
*   B. Maxillary expansion using a Hyrax appliance.
*   C. Extraction of the interfering primary canines.
*   **D. Selective occlusal adjustment of the interfering teeth.**

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The key finding is that the maxillary arch width is adequate and the crossbite is caused by a **functional shift** due to a **canine interference**. This is not a true skeletal crossbite. The patient's jaw shifts to the side to avoid the premature contact between the canines.
*   **Management:** Since the underlying skeletal structure is normal, the treatment is to simply eliminate the cause of the shift. This is done by performing a **selective occlusal adjustment** (selective grinding) on the interfering inclines of the primary canines. This removes the prematurity, allowing the mandible to close directly into a centered position without shifting, thereby correcting the crossbite. Expansion is not needed, and extraction is too aggressive.

### Question 97:

When surveying a diagnostic cast for a removable partial denture design, which of the following is the purpose of tripoding the master cast?

*   A. It locates the height of contour.
*   B. It identifies the most retentive undercut areas.
*   **C. It allows the path of insertion to be reproduced on the surveyor.**
*   D. It assists in identifying guiding planes.

**Explanation:**

*   After a dentist uses a surveyor to determine the most desirable path of insertion for a partial denture, they must have a way to record this specific orientation of the cast.
*   **Tripoding** is the method used to do this. With the cast locked in its final tilted position on the surveyor, the vertical analyzing rod is locked at a fixed height. Three widely spaced marks are then made on the cast with the tip of the rod.
*   Later, if the cast is removed, it can be placed back on the surveyor, and the tilt can be adjusted until the tip of the vertical rod simultaneously touches all three marks. This guarantees that the cast has been returned to the exact same orientation, allowing the chosen **path of insertion to be reproduced**.

### Question 98:

Two days following crown cementation on tooth #36, a patient returned to the clinic complaining of pain on biting. Upon examination, tooth #36 has a positive response to cold testing. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   **A. Check the occlusion of the crown for high spots.**
*   B. Remove the crown and place a temporary crown.
*   C. Perform root canal treatment on tooth #36 through the crown.
*   D. Prescribe muscle relaxants and fabricate an occlusal splint.

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The most common cause of pain on biting shortly after a new crown is cemented is a **hyperocclusion** or "high spot." The tooth is vital (positive cold test), so the issue is not pulpal. The pain is a result of occlusal trauma causing inflammation of the periodontal ligament.
*   **Management:** The first and most important step is to **check the occlusion** with articulating paper. If a high spot is identified, it should be carefully adjusted with a fine diamond bur until the occlusion is even and the patient is comfortable. This almost always resolves the symptom immediately. The other options are far too aggressive for this common and easily solved problem.

### Question 99:

Which of the following cytochrome P450 isoforms is most commonly involved in drug metabolism?

*   **A. CYP3A4**
*   B. CYP2D6
*   C. CYP2C8
*   D. CYP1A2

**Explanation:**

*   The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is a large family of enzymes primarily responsible for the metabolism of drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds in the liver.
*   While many isoforms exist, **CYP3A4** is by far the most abundant and most important isoform in humans. It is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 35-50% of all clinically used drugs.

### Question 100:

What is the maximum number of carpules of Articaine 4% with 1:200,000 epinephrine that can be given to a patient that weighs 35 kg?

*   A. 2
*   **B. 3**
*   C. 4
*   D. 5

**Explanation:**

*   **Step 1: Calculate the Maximum Recommended Dose (MRD) in mg.**
    *   The MRD for Articaine is 7 mg/kg.
    *   MRD = 7 mg/kg * 35 kg = **245 mg**.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the amount of Articaine in one carpule.**
    *   A 4% solution means 40 mg of drug per mL of solution.
    *   A standard dental carpule contains 1.8 mL of solution.
    *   mg per carpule = 40 mg/mL * 1.8 mL = **72 mg**.

*   **Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of carpules.**
    *   Max carpules = Total MRD / mg per carpule
    *   Max carpules = 245 mg / 72 mg/carpule = **3.4 carpules**.

*   **Step 4: Round Down.**
    *   Since you cannot give a fraction of a carpule, you must always round down to the nearest whole number to stay within the safe limit.
    *   The maximum number of carpules is **3**.
