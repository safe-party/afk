<p>Here are day 1 questions.</p>
<h3 id="question-1">Question 1:</h3>
<p>A 10-year-old child presents with migratory joint pain and swelling
two weeks after recovering from a streptococcal pharyngitis. Which of
the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?<br />
A. Direct damage by autoantibodies.<br />
B. Direct streptococcal pyogenes infection of the joints.<br />
C. Direct damage from exotoxins of the bacteria.<br />
<strong>D. Direct damage by antibodies that are produced against
bacterial antigens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This condition is rheumatic fever, an
autoimmune response triggered by a streptococcal infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The core mechanism is <strong>molecular mimicry</strong>. Antigens
on the <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> bacteria are structurally similar
to molecules on the surface of the host’s own cells (e.g., in the heart,
joints, and nervous system).</li>
<li>The body mounts an immune response, creating antibodies specifically
against the bacterial antigens to clear the infection.</li>
<li>After the infection is resolved, these same antibodies mistakenly
recognize and attack the body’s own similar-looking cells, causing
inflammation and damage in the joints, heart, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Option A is incorrect</strong> because these are not true
autoantibodies. True autoantibodies arise when the immune system loses
tolerance and creates antibodies against self-antigens <em>without</em>
a preceding foreign trigger like a bacterial infection. Here, the
antibodies were initially and correctly formed against a foreign
bacterium.</li>
<li><strong>Options B and C are incorrect</strong> because the damage is
not caused by a direct infection of the joints or by bacterial toxins.
The damage is immune-mediated and occurs <em>after</em> the initial
infection has been cleared.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2:</h3>
<p>Which of the following implant sites would benefit the most from
countersinking? A. Posterior mandible. B. Maxilla. <strong>C. Anterior
mandible.</strong> D. Maxillary tuberosity.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Countersinking is a procedure where the
coronal portion of an implant osteotomy is widened using a specific
countersink drill.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The coronal part of many implants is wider
than the body. In very dense bone, this wider portion can encounter
significant resistance, preventing the implant from seating fully to the
bone crest level. Countersinking widens only this coronal part of the
site to allow the implant to seat properly without excessive
compression, which could lead to bone necrosis.</li>
<li><strong>Indication:</strong> Countersinking is indicated
specifically in areas with very dense cortical bone at the crest of the
ridge.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> The <strong>anterior
mandible</strong> is characterized by the densest bone in the oral
cavity (D1 or D2 bone), which is primarily thick cortical bone.
Therefore, it is the site that most often requires and benefits from
countersinking.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> The maxilla generally has more
porous bone (D3/D4), and the posterior mandible is typically less dense
than the anterior. These sites usually do not require countersinking as
the bone is compressible enough to accommodate the implant.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-3">Question 3:</h3>
<p>Following the initiation of warfarin therapy, which of the following
clotting factors shows the most rapid decline in blood levels? A. Factor
II (Prothrombin) <strong>B. Factor VII</strong> C. Factor IX D. Factor
X</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Warfarin is a Vitamin K antagonist,
inhibiting the synthesis of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II,
VII, IX, and X). The factor that declines most rapidly determines how
quickly the drug’s effect can be measured.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rate of decline depends on the <strong>half-life</strong> of
each factor already present in the circulation.</li>
<li><strong>Factor VII</strong> has the shortest half-life, at only
<strong>4-6 hours</strong>.</li>
<li>The other factors have much longer half-lives: Factor IX (20-30
hours), Factor X (24-40 hours), and Factor II (60-72 hours).</li>
<li>Because it is cleared from the blood the fastest, Factor VII is the
first factor to show a significant drop in levels after warfarin therapy
begins.</li>
<li>This is why the Prothrombin Time (PT) / INR test, which is highly
sensitive to levels of Factor VII (as it’s in the extrinsic pathway), is
used to monitor warfarin therapy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-4">Question 4:</h3>
<p>In which of the following cases is endodontic treatment likely to be
most technically challenging? A. A maxillary central incisor with a
stone in the pulp chamber. B. A maxillary premolar with two roots.
<strong>C. A mandibular second molar with fused roots and
torodontism.</strong> D. A mandibular first molar with three canals.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The difficulty of an endodontic case is
determined by canal anatomy, morphology, and access.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A mandibular second molar with
fused roots and torodontism presents the greatest challenge.
<ul>
<li><strong>Torodontism</strong> means the pulp chamber is very large
and apically displaced, making it difficult to locate the canal
orifices, which are deep within the tooth.</li>
<li><strong>Fused roots</strong> in a mandibular second molar are highly
indicative of a <strong>C-shaped canal system</strong>.</li>
<li>C-shaped canals are notoriously difficult to debride, shape, and
obturate due to their complex, ribbon-like anatomy with isthmuses and
fins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A pulp stone (A) is a common and relatively simple obstruction to
remove.</li>
<li>A two-rooted maxillary premolar (B) is a normal, straightforward
variation.</li>
<li>A mandibular first molar with three canals (D) is the standard and
most predictable case for a molar root canal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-5">Question 5:</h3>
<p>A 58-year-old patient with a history of myocardial infarction is
taking daily low-dose aspirin as part of his prevention therapy. What is
the primary mechanism by which aspirin reduces the risk of thrombotic
events in these patients? <strong>A. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1
(COX-1).</strong> B. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). C.
Inhibition of prostaglandin E. D. Inhibition of thrombin.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Aspirin’s anti-thrombotic
(antiplatelet) effect is achieved at low doses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Low-dose aspirin <strong>irreversibly
inhibits the COX-1 enzyme</strong> within platelets.</li>
<li>COX-1 is responsible for converting arachidonic acid into
<strong>Thromboxane A2 (TXA2)</strong>.</li>
<li>TXA2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and, most importantly, a powerful
promoter of platelet aggregation.</li>
<li>By blocking TXA2 synthesis, aspirin prevents platelets from clumping
together, thus reducing the risk of forming a thrombus (blood
clot).</li>
<li>The inhibition is <strong>irreversible</strong> because platelets
lack a nucleus and cannot synthesize new COX-1 enzyme. The effect lasts
for the entire lifespan of the platelet (7-10 days).</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li>COX-2 inhibition (B) is related to aspirin’s anti-inflammatory
effects at higher doses.</li>
<li>Inhibition of prostaglandin E (C) is a side effect of COX-1
inhibition (leading to reduced GI protection) but is not the mechanism
for its antiplatelet effect.</li>
<li>Aspirin does not inhibit thrombin (D); that is the mechanism of
other anticoagulants.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-6">Question 6:</h3>
<p>The main respiratory drive in a patient with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) is: A. Hypercapnic drive <strong>B. Hypoxic
drive</strong> C. Baroreceptor stimulation D. Respiratory alkalosis</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * In a healthy individual, the primary
respiratory drive is the <strong>hypercapnic drive</strong>.
Chemoreceptors in the brainstem are highly sensitive to levels of CO2 in
the blood. When CO2 rises, breathing is stimulated. * In patients with
severe COPD, they chronically retain high levels of CO2 (hypercapnia).
Over time, the central chemoreceptors become desensitized to these high
CO2 levels, and the hypercapnic drive becomes ineffective. * The body
then switches to a backup system: the <strong>hypoxic drive</strong>.
Peripheral chemoreceptors (in the carotid and aortic bodies) become the
primary stimulus for breathing. These receptors are sensitive to low
levels of oxygen (hypoxia). * Therefore, in a COPD patient, a drop in
blood oxygen is what stimulates them to breathe. This is why
administering high-flow oxygen can be dangerous, as it can eliminate
their only drive to breathe.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-7">Question 7:</h3>
<p>What sequence of steps is deemed the most suitable for the donning
(putting on) of personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to patient
treatment? A. Gown, Mask, Goggles, Gloves, Hand Hygiene B. Gloves, Gown,
Mask, Goggles, Hand Hygiene <strong>C. Hand Hygiene, Gown, Mask,
Goggles, Gloves</strong> D. Hand Hygiene, Gloves, Mask, Goggles,
Gown</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The correct sequence for donning PPE is
designed to minimize contamination, moving from cleanest to
dirtiest.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Hand Hygiene:</strong> Start with clean hands to avoid
contaminating the PPE you are about to put on.</li>
<li><strong>Gown:</strong> Put on the gown first.</li>
<li><strong>Mask/Respirator:</strong> Secure the mask over your nose and
mouth.</li>
<li><strong>Goggles/Face Shield:</strong> Put on eye protection.</li>
<li><strong>Gloves:</strong> Put on gloves last. The gloves should go
over the cuffs of the gown.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence ensures that your hands are clean before touching your
face (for the mask and goggles) and that the gloves are the last, most
“contaminated” item to be put on before touching the patient.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-8">Question 8:</h3>
<p>A 65-year-old diabetic patient is found to have an oroantral
communication after an extraction, and a buccal advancement flap is
necessary. Which of the following types of suture is the most
appropriate for this procedure? A. Silk B. Plain catgut C. Chromic
catgut <strong>D. Vicryl (Polyglactin)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The choice of suture depends on the
patient’s condition (diabetic, delayed healing) and the surgical site
(major flap requiring stable, long-term closure).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patient Factors:</strong> Diabetic patients experience
delayed wound healing.</li>
<li><strong>Surgical Factors:</strong> A buccal advancement flap is a
major procedure that requires the sutures to maintain tension and hold
the flap securely for an extended period (more than 1-2 weeks).</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plain Catgut:</strong> Resorbs in 3-5 days. Completely
inappropriate as it will dissolve before any meaningful healing
occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Chromic Catgut:</strong> Resorbs in 7-14 days. This is still
too short for a diabetic patient’s delayed healing. It is also a natural
material that can induce a significant inflammatory tissue
reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Silk:</strong> A non-resorbable suture. It is strong and
maintains tension well, but has two major disadvantages: 1) It has a
high “wicking effect,” allowing bacteria to travel along the suture and
potentially infect the site. 2) It requires a second appointment for
removal, which can be traumatic and cause bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>Vicryl (Polyglactin):</strong> A synthetic, braided,
resorbable suture. This is the best choice because:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Longevity:</strong> It retains significant tensile strength
for 3-4 weeks and fully resorbs in 56-70 days, providing long-term
support that is ideal for a diabetic patient’s healing timeline.</li>
<li><strong>Biocompatibility:</strong> As a synthetic material that
resorbs via hydrolysis, it causes minimal tissue reaction compared to
natural sutures like gut or silk.</li>
<li><strong>Resorbable:</strong> It does not require a removal
appointment.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="question-9">Question 9:</h3>
<p>During a lateral mandibular movement, which of the following cusp
inclines of the maxillary teeth are most likely to cause a non-working
side interference? A. Lingual inclines of the buccal cusps <strong>B.
Buccal inclines of the palatal cusps</strong> C. Lingual inclines of the
palatal cusps D. Buccal inclines of the buccal cusps</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question tests knowledge of
occlusal contacts during lateral excursions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Side:</strong> The side the mandible moves
<em>towards</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Working Side (or Balancing Side):</strong> The side the
mandible moves <em>away from</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Working Side Interference:</strong> This is a contact
between the maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth on the non-working
side. It is considered the most destructive type of interference.</li>
<li><strong>The specific contact is:</strong> The <strong>inner
inclines</strong> of the <strong>functional cusps</strong>.
<ul>
<li>In the maxilla, the functional cusps are the <strong>palatal
cusps</strong>. Their inner aspect is the <strong>buccal
incline</strong>.</li>
<li>In the mandible, the functional cusps are the <strong>buccal
cusps</strong>. Their inner aspect is the <strong>lingual
incline</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Therefore, the non-working side interference on the maxilla occurs
on the <strong>buccal inclines of the palatal cusps</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-10">Question 10:</h3>
<p>Which of the following describes the effect of epinephrine on cardiac
output and myocardial oxygen demand? <strong>A. Increases cardiac output
and increases oxygen demand.</strong> B. Increases cardiac output
without a change in oxygen demand. C. Decreases cardiac output and
increases oxygen demand. D. Decreases cardiac output without a change in
oxygen demand.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic drug
that stimulates alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effect on the Heart (Beta-1 stimulation):</strong>
Epinephrine directly stimulates Beta-1 receptors in the heart, leading
to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Heart Rate</strong> (Positive Chronotropy)</li>
<li><strong>Increased Contractility</strong> (Positive Inotropy - the
force of contraction)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Effect on Cardiac Output:</strong> Cardiac Output = Heart
Rate × Stroke Volume. Since epinephrine increases both heart rate and
contractility (which increases stroke volume), the overall
<strong>cardiac output increases</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Effect on Oxygen Demand:</strong> When the heart beats
faster and more forcefully, it is performing more work. This increased
workload requires more energy, and therefore <strong>increases the
heart’s demand for oxygen</strong>.</li>
<li>This is why epinephrine must be used with caution in patients with
ischemic heart disease, as the increased oxygen demand may not be met by
a compromised coronary circulation, potentially leading to angina or a
myocardial infarction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-11">Question 11:</h3>
<p>Following the extraction of tooth #38, the site bleeds profusely. The
dentist failed to obtain the patient’s medical history, and it turns out
the patient has hemophilia A. Which of the following ethical principles
has been violated by the dentist? A. Autonomy B. Beneficence <strong>C.
Nonmaleficence</strong> D. Justice</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This scenario involves causing direct
harm to a patient through negligence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nonmaleficence:</strong> This is the core principle of “do
no harm.” It obligates a healthcare provider to avoid causing
unnecessary pain or suffering to a patient. By failing to take a medical
history—a fundamental step in patient safety—the dentist performed a
procedure that directly resulted in harm (profuse, uncontrolled
bleeding). This is a clear violation of nonmaleficence.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong> refers to the patient’s right to
self-determination and informed consent. While related, the primary
violation here is the physical harm caused, not the failure to respect
the patient’s decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Beneficence</strong> is the duty to act in the best interest
of the patient or to “do good.” While failing to take a history is not
“doing good,” the more direct and severe violation is actively causing
harm, which falls under nonmaleficence.</li>
<li><strong>Justice</strong> refers to fairness in treatment and
allocation of resources. It is not relevant to this clinical error.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-12">Question 12:</h3>
<p>A new intervention reduces the risk of peri-implantitis from 6% to
2%. What is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT)? A. 10 B. 15 C. 20
<strong>D. 25</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the
average number of patients who need to receive a specific treatment to
prevent one additional bad outcome. A lower NNT indicates a more
effective treatment.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):</strong> This
is the difference in risk between the control group and the treated
group.
<ul>
<li>Risk in control group (no intervention) = 6% or 0.06</li>
<li>Risk in treated group (intervention) = 2% or 0.02</li>
<li>ARR = Risk(control) - Risk(treated) = 6% - 2% = 4%</li>
<li>ARR = 0.06 - 0.02 = 0.04</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Calculate the NNT:</strong> The NNT is the reciprocal of the
ARR.
<ul>
<li>NNT = 1 / ARR</li>
<li>NNT = 1 / 0.04</li>
<li>NNT = 25</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This means you would need to treat 25 patients with the new
intervention to prevent one case of peri-implantitis.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-13">Question 13:</h3>
<p>A 5-year-old patient has an intruded primary tooth #51. Radiographic
examination reveals foreshortening of the tooth. Which of the following
is the most appropriate management? <strong>A. Periodic
observation.</strong> B. Pulpectomy. C. Pulpotomy. D. Immediate
extraction.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question deals with the management
of a traumatic intrusion injury to a primary tooth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intruded Primary Tooth:</strong> The standard of care for an
intruded primary incisor, regardless of its position relative to the
permanent tooth bud, is to <strong>allow for spontaneous
re-eruption</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Foreshortening:</strong> A foreshortened radiographic image
indicates that the apex of the intruded tooth has been displaced
labially/buccally, away from the developing permanent tooth germ. This
is a favorable sign, but it does not change the management. (An
elongated image would suggest palatal/lingual displacement toward the
germ).</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> Active treatment like extraction or
repositioning is generally avoided as it carries a high risk of damaging
the underlying permanent tooth. The tooth should be monitored for
re-eruption, which typically occurs within 6 months. Extraction is only
indicated if the tooth becomes infected or fails to re-erupt.</li>
<li>Therefore, the correct management is <strong>periodic
observation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-14">Question 14:</h3>
<p>A patient’s radiographic evaluation reveals that all teeth have
normal crown shapes but exhibit short roots and obliterated pulp
chambers. Which of the following conditions is most likely associated
with these findings? <strong>A. Dentin dysplasia type I</strong> B.
Dentin dysplasia type II C. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type II D.
Dentinogenesis imperfecta type III</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key features are <strong>normal
crowns</strong> but abnormal roots and pulps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dentin Dysplasia Type I (Radicular Type):</strong> This is
the classic presentation. The crowns are clinically and morphologically
normal in shape and color. The defining features are radiographic:
extremely short or “rootless” teeth, obliterated pulp chambers before
eruption, and frequent periapical radiolucencies.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dentin Dysplasia Type II (Coronal Type):</strong> Primary
teeth resemble dentinogenesis imperfecta (opalescent, bulbous).
Permanent teeth have normal color but abnormal pulp morphology,
specifically “thistle-tube” or flame-shaped pulp chambers, which are
enlarged, not obliterated.</li>
<li><strong>Dentinogenesis Imperfecta (Types II and III):</strong> The
most prominent feature is abnormal crowns. They are typically opalescent
(blue-gray or yellow-brown), bulbous in shape, and show marked
attrition. While pulps are obliterated and roots are short, the abnormal
crown appearance rules it out. Type III (Brandywine type) is severe,
with “shell teeth” and multiple pulp exposures.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-15">Question 15:</h3>
<p>A 23-year-old female patient presents with bilateral dislocation of
the mandibular condyles. Her symptoms have been recurring with frequent
yawning. Which of the following is the most appropriate management? A.
Arthroscopy B. Splint therapy C. Arthrocentesis <strong>D.
Eminectomy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The patient is suffering from chronic
recurrent dislocation, also known as subluxation. This is a mechanical
problem where the condyle moves anterior to the articular eminence and
gets locked.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conservative treatments</strong> like splints might be
tried, but for a recurring mechanical locking issue, a surgical solution
is often necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Eminectomy:</strong> This is a surgical procedure that
involves recontouring or reducing the height of the articular eminence.
By flattening the eminence, the path of the condyle is no longer
obstructed, preventing it from getting stuck in an anteriorly dislocated
position. This is a definitive treatment for chronic recurrent
dislocation.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arthrocentesis</strong> (lavaging the joint space) and
<strong>Arthroscopy</strong> (visualizing the joint) are primarily used
for internal derangements involving disc displacement, inflammation, and
adhesions (e.g., closed lock), not for a purely mechanical issue of the
condyle passing over the eminence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-16">Question 16:</h3>
<p>Acantholysis is a histological feature seen in which of the following
lesions? A. Mucous membrane pemphigoid <strong>B. Pemphigus
vulgaris</strong> C. Lichen planus D. Erythema multiforme</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Acantholysis</strong> is the
loss of intercellular cohesion between keratinocytes (epithelial cells)
due to the breakdown of desmosomes. This results in the formation of
intraepithelial blisters and the presence of free-floating, rounded
epithelial cells called <strong>Tzanck cells</strong>. *
<strong>Pemphigus Vulgaris:</strong> This is the classic example of a
disease caused by acantholysis. It is an autoimmune condition where
autoantibodies target desmoglein proteins, which are components of
desmosomes. This attack leads to the separation of epithelial cells from
each other. * <strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> * <strong>Mucous
Membrane Pemphigoid:</strong> The autoimmune attack is on the basement
membrane components (hemidesmosomes), causing a clean separation of the
entire epithelial layer from the underlying connective tissue. This is a
<strong>subepithelial split</strong>, not acantholysis. * <strong>Lichen
Planus</strong> and <strong>Erythema Multiforme</strong> have different
histopathologic mechanisms and do not exhibit acantholysis as their
primary feature.</p>

<h3 id="question-17">Question 17:</h3>
<p>A patient who consumed alcohol the previous night presents to your
office for a tooth extraction. After the procedure, the patient is given
acetaminophen to manage postoperative pain. Which of the following is
the most likely outcome? <strong>A. Increased pain control due to
microsomal enzyme inhibition.</strong> B. Increased pain control due to
underlying liver disease. C. Insufficient pain control due to microsomal
enzyme induction. D. No effect on pain control.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The effect of alcohol on liver
metabolism depends on whether the consumption is acute or chronic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acute Alcohol Consumption (e.g., “the previous
night”):</strong> Acute intake of alcohol <strong>inhibits</strong> the
activity of the cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme system in the
liver.</li>
<li><strong>Effect on Acetaminophen:</strong> Acetaminophen is
metabolized by these enzymes. When the enzymes are inhibited, the
metabolism of acetaminophen is slowed down.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Slower metabolism leads to higher and more
prolonged plasma concentrations of the drug, resulting in a more
pronounced or <strong>increased effect</strong> (in this case, increased
analgesia).</li>
<li><strong>Chronic Alcoholism (Contrast):</strong> Chronic alcohol
consumption has the opposite effect; it <em>induces</em> (upregulates)
the liver enzymes. In a chronic alcoholic, acetaminophen would be
metabolized <em>faster</em>, leading to lower plasma levels and
insufficient pain control (Option C).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="question-18">Question 18:</h3>
<p>A researcher is evaluating two different periodontal treatments.
Patients are assigned to treatment groups based on which clinic they
visit (Clinic A vs. Clinic B), with one clinic offering only the basic
treatment and the other providing an antibiotic adjunct. Which of the
following biases does this study design risk introducing? A. Recall bias
<strong>B. Confounding</strong> C. Selection bias D. Surveillance
bias</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This study design lacks randomization
and groups patients by a pre-existing characteristic (which clinic they
attend).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confounding:</strong> A confounder is a third variable that
is associated with both the exposure (the treatment) and the outcome
(pocket depth reduction) and can distort the true relationship between
them. In this case, the <strong>clinic itself is a major confounding
factor</strong>.
<ul>
<li>For example, patients who go to the more advanced Clinic B might
have more severe disease to begin with. Or, Clinic B might have better
clinicians or follow-up protocols. These factors, related to the clinic
and not the antibiotic itself, could influence the outcome. The observed
effect might be due to the “clinic effect” rather than the treatment
effect.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selection Bias</strong> occurs when the method of choosing
participants creates an unrepresentative sample. While related,
confounding is the more precise term here because the bias comes from a
third variable (the clinic) that is unevenly distributed between the
treatment groups.</li>
<li><strong>Recall Bias</strong> relates to inaccuracies in
participants’ memory of past events; it’s not relevant in this
interventional study.</li>
<li><strong>Surveillance Bias</strong> occurs when one group is
monitored more closely than another, leading to more frequent detection
of outcomes. This is not the primary flaw described.</li>

<h3 id="question-19">Question 19:</h3>
<p>Chlorothiazide is a weakly acidic drug with a pKa of 6.5. If
administered orally, at which of the following sites of absorption will
the drug be most readily able to pass through the membrane? A. Mouth (pH
7.1) <strong>B. Stomach (pH 2.5)</strong> C. Duodenum (pH 7.2) D. Ileum
(pH 8.0)</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The principle of drug absorption across
lipid membranes is that drugs pass most easily in their
<strong>non-ionized, lipid-soluble</strong> form. The
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation governs this relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Rule:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>acidic drug</strong> will be mostly non-ionized in an
<strong>acidic environment</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>basic drug</strong> will be mostly non-ionized in a
<strong>basic (alkaline) environment</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong> Chlorothiazide is a weakly acidic
drug. To be in its non-ionized form for easy absorption, it needs to be
in an acidic environment.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Of the options provided, the
<strong>stomach (pH ~2.5)</strong> is the most acidic environment.
Therefore, the acidic drug will be most readily absorbed there. In the

<h3 id="question-20">Question 20:</h3>
<p>Which of the following statements best explains why cranial vault
bones exhibit appositional growth rather than interstitial growth? A.
The presence of synchondroses. <strong>B. The lack of a cartilage
precursor.</strong> C. The influence of lymphoid tissue proliferation.
D. They are derived from ectoderm.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> There are two main types of bone
growth:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Interstitial Growth:</strong> Growth from within. This is
only possible in cartilage, where chondrocytes can divide and secrete
new matrix, expanding the tissue from the inside. This is how long bones
grow in length at the epiphyseal plates (a process of endochondral
ossification).</li>
<li><strong>Appositional Growth:</strong> Growth by adding new layers to
the outer surface. Osteoblasts on the surface of the bone deposit new
bone matrix. All bones can grow in width this way.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cranial Vault Bones:</strong> These bones (e.g., frontal,
parietal) are formed by <strong>intramembranous ossification</strong>.
This process does not involve a cartilage model. Bone forms directly
within a membrane of mesenchymal tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Because the cranial vault bones
<strong>lack a cartilage precursor</strong>, they are incapable of
interstitial growth. Their growth occurs solely by appositional growth
at their surfaces and sutures.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Option A:</strong> Synchondroses (cartilaginous
joints) are characteristic of the cranial <em>base</em>, which undergoes
endochondral ossification and does exhibit interstitial growth.</li>

<p>In a patient with a complete cleft lip and palate, when is the
optimal time to perform an alveolar bone graft? A. After the permanent
canine on the cleft side has fully erupted. <strong>B. Just before the
permanent canine on the cleft side begins erupting.</strong> C. During
the initial lip repair surgery. D. At any time based on the patient’s
convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The timing of surgeries for cleft lip
and palate is critical and follows a specific sequence to optimize
growth and function.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alveolar Bone Graft Purpose:</strong> The goal is to create
a bony bridge across the alveolar cleft to:
<ol type="1">
<li>Unite the maxillary segments and stabilize the arch.</li>
<li>Provide bone for the permanent canine to erupt into.</li>
<li>Provide periodontal support for the teeth adjacent to the
cleft.</li>
<li>Close the oro-nasal fistula.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Optimal Timing:</strong> The procedure is timed to coincide
with the eruption of the permanent canine. It is performed during the
mixed dentition stage (<strong>ages 6-10 years</strong>), specifically
<strong>just before the canine erupts</strong>, when the canine root is
approximately 1/2 to 2/3 formed.</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Placing the graft before eruption allows
the canine to erupt through the newly grafted bone, which stimulates the
bone, helps develop a normal periodontal ligament, and brings its own
alveolar bone housing with it, leading to a much more stable and
physiologic result. Performing it after eruption (A) would be much less
effective. Performing it during initial lip repair (C) would restrict
maxillary growth.</li>

<p>Which of the following medications increases a patient’s risk of
intraoral candidiasis? A. Warfarin <strong>B. Cyclosporine</strong> C.
Omeprazole D. Metformin</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Intraoral candidiasis is an
opportunistic infection caused by the fungus <em>Candida albicans</em>.
It flourishes when the host’s immune system is compromised.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyclosporine:</strong> This is a potent
<strong>immunosuppressant</strong> drug. It is commonly prescribed to
prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat various autoimmune
diseases. By suppressing the immune system, cyclosporine significantly
increases the risk of opportunistic infections, including oral
candidiasis.</li>
<li><strong>Other Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warfarin</strong> is an anticoagulant.</li>
<li><strong>Omeprazole</strong> is a proton pump inhibitor used for acid
reflux.</li>
<li><strong>Metformin</strong> is an antidiabetic medication.</li>
<li>While poorly controlled diabetes can be a risk factor for
candidiasis, cyclosporine directly causes immunosuppression, making it
the most direct and potent risk factor among the choices.</li>

<h3 id="question-23">Question 23:</h3>
<p>A 55-year-old patient is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy for
squamous cell carcinoma. During dental examination, a bony impacted and
healthy tooth #37 was discovered. Which of the following is the most
appropriate management for this patient? A. Extract the tooth and start
chemotherapy after 3 weeks of healing. B. Extract the tooth and start
chemotherapy immediately. <strong>C. Start chemotherapy without the
extraction of tooth #37.</strong> D. Defer chemotherapy and monitor the
tooth for 6 months.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The decision involves weighing the risk
of delaying cancer treatment against the risk of the tooth causing a
complication during chemotherapy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk of Extraction:</strong> Extracting the tooth would
require delaying life-saving chemotherapy for several weeks to allow for
initial healing. For an aggressive cancer like SCC, any delay can
negatively impact the patient’s prognosis.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Retention:</strong> The risk is that the tooth could
become infected during or after chemotherapy when the patient is
severely immunocompromised. An infection at that stage would be a
serious complication.</li>
<li><strong>The Key Information:</strong> The tooth is described as
<strong>“bony impacted”</strong> and <strong>“healthy.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clinical Guideline:</strong> A tooth that is fully impacted
in bone with no associated pathology (no cysts, no communication with
the oral cavity) has a very low risk of causing problems. The risk of
delaying cancer treatment is far greater than the low risk posed by
retaining the asymptomatic, fully impacted tooth.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The most appropriate management is to
<strong>proceed with chemotherapy without delay</strong> and leave the
tooth in place. Extracting the tooth is not indicated and would cause
unacceptable harm by delaying cancer care.</li>

<p>Which of the following is true with regards to Lesion Sterilization
and Tissue Repair (LSTR)? A. It involves the instrumentation of the root
canal of primary teeth. <strong>B. It is indicated for primary teeth
with irreversible pulpitis or necrosis.</strong> C. It is always
preferred over pulpectomy. D. The recommended antibiotic mixture
contains minocycline.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> LSTR is a biological approach to
treating infected primary teeth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Statement (B):</strong> LSTR is a treatment option
for non-vital primary teeth, meaning those with <strong>irreversible
pulpitis or necrosis</strong>. Its goal is to disinfect the canal system
to allow for healing and preserve the tooth until normal
exfoliation.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>(A) No Instrumentation:</strong> LSTR is fundamentally a
<strong>non-instrumentation</strong> technique. The pulp chamber is
opened and irrigated, but files are not used within the canals.</li>
<li><strong>(C) Not Always Preferred:</strong> Pulpectomy is the
traditional treatment of choice. LSTR is typically considered when a
pulpectomy is not feasible, such as in teeth with significant root
resorption where instrumentation would be difficult or impossible.</li>
<li><strong>(D) No Minocycline:</strong> The classic LSTR antibiotic
paste is a “triple-mix” of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and
clindamycin. <strong>Minocycline</strong> (a tetracycline) was part of
an earlier formulation but is now avoided because it causes significant
tooth discoloration.</li>

<p>A 28-year-old patient presents with gingivitis. Clinical examination
reveals gingival erythema and bleeding on probing, without clinical
attachment loss. Histologically, which type of cells would most likely
predominate the affected gingival tissue? A. Polymorphonuclear cells
(PMNs) and macrophages B. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and
T-lymphocytes <strong>C. T-lymphocytes and plasma cells</strong> D.
B-lymphocytes and mast cells</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The clinical signs (erythema, bleeding,
no attachment loss) are characteristic of <strong>established
gingivitis</strong>. Gingivitis progresses through distinct histological
stages with different predominant cell types.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Lesion (2-4 days):</strong> Primarily <strong>PMNs
(neutrophils)</strong> and some macrophages. Clinically, it is not very
apparent.</li>
<li><strong>Early Lesion (4-7 days):</strong> PMNs are still present,
but <strong>T-lymphocytes</strong> begin to dominate the infiltrate.
Clinical signs like erythema begin to appear.</li>
<li><strong>Established Lesion (2-3 weeks and beyond):</strong> This is
chronic gingivitis. The lesion is now dominated by <strong>plasma
cells</strong> and <strong>T-lymphocytes</strong>. Plasma cells are
activated B-cells that produce antibodies. This stage corresponds to the
classic clinical signs of gingivitis.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Lesion (Periodontitis):</strong> The infiltrate is
similar to the established lesion, but now there is bone loss and
attachment loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the patient has clear clinical signs of chronic gingivitis, the
histology will reflect the established lesion, which is predominated by
T-lymphocytes and plasma cells.</p>

<p>A 58-year-old male presents with recurrent swelling in the lower
right posterior region. Clinical examination reveals a periodontal
pocket associated with tooth #46 with purulent exudate upon probing. A
fistula is observed on the buccal gingiva. Tooth #46 produces a positive
response to vitality testing. What is the most likely diagnosis? A.
Chronic apical abscess B. Acute apical abscess C. Endo-perio lesion
<strong>D. Periodontal abscess</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key to this diagnosis is
integrating the clinical signs with the pulp vitality test result.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clinical Signs:</strong> The signs—a deep periodontal
pocket, purulent (pus) exudate, swelling, and a fistula—all point
towards an abscess.</li>
<li><strong>Pulp Vitality:</strong> The tooth gives a <strong>positive
response to vitality testing</strong>. This is the crucial piece of
information. A positive response means the pulp is vital (alive).</li>
<li><strong>Differential Diagnosis:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apical Abscess (A, B):</strong> An apical abscess is of
endodontic origin, meaning the pulp is necrotic (dead). The tooth would
therefore be non-vital and would not respond to vitality testing.</li>
<li><strong>Endo-Perio Lesion (C):</strong> A primary endodontic lesion
(with or without secondary perio involvement) would also originate from
a necrotic pulp, so the tooth would be non-vital.</li>
<li><strong>Periodontal Abscess (D):</strong> This is an abscess that
originates from the periodontal tissues (the gingiva and periodontal
ligament), typically from a pre-existing deep periodontal pocket. The
pulp of the tooth is not involved and remains vital.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Since the tooth is vital, the infection
must be purely periodontal in origin. This is a classic presentation of
a periodontal abscess.</li>

<p>Which of the following features is most commonly associated with a
higher than average mandibular plane angle on a cephalometric analysis?
<strong>A. Increased lower anterior facial height</strong> B. Decreased
lower anterior facial height C. Deep bite D. Horizontal growth
pattern</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The mandibular plane angle is a key
indicator of a patient’s vertical facial dimension and growth
pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Mandibular Plane Angle (Steep Mandible):</strong> This
indicates a <strong>vertical growth pattern</strong>. The mandible has
grown more downward and backward than forward. This pattern is
associated with:
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased lower anterior facial height (LAFH)</strong>.</li>
<li>A long, narrow face.</li>
<li>A tendency towards an anterior open bite.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Low Mandibular Plane Angle (Flat Mandible):</strong> This
indicates a <strong>horizontal growth pattern</strong>. The mandible has
grown more forward than downward. This pattern is associated with:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decreased (short) lower anterior facial height
(LAFH)</strong>.</li>
<li>A short, square face.</li>
<li>A tendency towards a deep bite.</li>

<p>Under which of the following conditions is a lingual plate major
connector indicated instead of a lingual bar? A. When more rigidity is
required. B. When the remaining teeth are widely spaced. <strong>C. When
the remaining anterior teeth have lost periodontal support.</strong> D.
When there is sufficient space in the floor of the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A lingual bar is generally the major
connector of choice for a mandibular RPD due to its hygienic design. A
lingual plate is chosen only when specific indications are met.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Indication for Lingual Plate:</strong> The most
important indication is when the remaining anterior teeth are
<strong>periodontally compromised</strong> and have lost bone support.
<ul>
<li>The lingual plate covers the cingula of the anterior teeth and acts
as a <strong>splint</strong>, providing support, distributing occlusal
forces, and stabilizing the weakened teeth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Another Key Indication:</strong> When there is
<strong>insufficient floor of mouth depth</strong> (less than 7-8mm from
the gingival margin to the floor of the mouth) to accommodate the height
of a lingual bar without impinging on the tissues.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><ol type="A">
<li>A properly designed lingual bar is sufficiently rigid for almost all
cases. Rigidity is not the primary reason to choose a plate.</li>
</ol></li>

<p>Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of
estrogen on bone? A. Increased osteoclast proliferation. B. Increased
induction of osteoclasts through cytokines. <strong>C. Increased
osteoclast apoptosis.</strong> D. Decreasing osteoclast apoptosis.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Estrogen plays a crucial
anti-resorptive role in maintaining bone density. It works primarily by
regulating the activity and lifespan of osteoclasts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Mechanism:</strong> Estrogen’s main effect is to
<strong>increase osteoclast apoptosis</strong> (programmed cell death).
By promoting the death of osteoclasts, it reduces the total number of
active bone-resorbing cells, which shifts the balance of bone remodeling
towards formation and away from resorption.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Mechanism:</strong> Estrogen also suppresses the
production of pro-resorptive cytokines (like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha)
and inhibits the RANKL/RANK signaling pathway, which is essential for
osteoclast differentiation and activation.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> Options A, B, and D all describe
effects that would lead to <em>increased</em> bone resorption, which is
the opposite of estrogen’s function. The bone loss seen in
postmenopausal women is a direct result of the loss of these protective
estrogen effects.</li>

<p>Mild unilateral maxillary constriction will most likely result in: A.
Unilateral posterior crossbite without a functional shift. <strong>B.
Unilateral posterior crossbite with a functional shift.</strong> C.
Bilateral posterior crossbite. D. Edge-to-edge occlusion with no
crossbite.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key to this question is the word
<strong>“mild.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mild Constriction:</strong> When the maxillary arch is only
mildly constricted, the posterior teeth on that side will occlude in a
<strong>cusp-to-cusp</strong> or <strong>edge-to-edge</strong>
relationship in centric relation.</li>
<li><strong>Functional Shift:</strong> This cusp-to-cusp position is
unstable and inefficient for chewing. To achieve a more stable occlusion
with better intercuspation, the patient will subconsciously
<strong>shift their mandible</strong> to the side of the
constriction.</li>
<li><strong>Resulting Occlusion:</strong> This shift moves the
mandibular teeth further buccally on the constricted side, creating a
<strong>unilateral posterior crossbite</strong>. Because the crossbite
is only present <em>after</em> the mandible has shifted from its centric
position, it is defined as a unilateral posterior crossbite <strong>with
a functional shift</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast with Severe Constriction:</strong> If the
constriction were severe, the maxillary teeth would already be fully
palatal to the mandibular teeth in centric relation. There would be no
initial cusp-to-cusp interference and therefore no need for the mandible
to shift. This would result in a “true” bilateral or unilateral
crossbite <em>without</em> a functional shift.</li>

<p>In constructing a mandibular complete denture for a patient with a
resorbed ridge, the artificial teeth in the molar region should be
placed where? A. Labial to the residual ridge B. Over the residual ridge
<strong>C. Lingual to the residual ridge</strong> D. Any of the
above</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The placement of denture teeth should
be in the “neutral zone” to ensure stability. This zone is determined by
the balance of forces from the tongue and the cheeks. The pattern of
bone resorption dictates where this neutral zone is relative to the
current ridge crest.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandibular Resorption Pattern:</strong> In the posterior
region, the mandible resorbs primarily from the occlusal and lingual
aspects, causing the crest of the residual ridge to become positioned
more buccally than the original position of the teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral Zone:</strong> To place the teeth back in their
original, stable position, they must be set <strong>lingual</strong> to
the new, buccally-positioned ridge crest.</li>
<li><strong>Other Areas:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anterior Region:</strong> The ridge resorbs more from the
labial, so teeth are set slightly labial to the ridge.</li>
<li><strong>Premolar Region:</strong> Resorption is more even, so teeth
are set directly over the ridge. Placing teeth over the ridge in the
molar area of a resorbed mandible would position them too far buccally,
leading to instability.</li>

<p>Which of the following types of surgeries is the most appropriate for
the management of a 5-millimeter mid-buccal recession affecting teeth
#11, #12, and #13? <strong>A. Subepithelial connective tissue graft
(SCTG)</strong> B. Free gingival graft (FGG) C. Laterally positioned
flap D. Coronally positioned flap</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The choice of procedure depends on the
recession depth, location (aesthetic zone), and the amount of remaining
keratinized tissue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft (SCTG):</strong> This
is the gold standard for root coverage, especially for deep recessions
in the aesthetic zone. It has a dual blood supply, results in excellent
color match, and is highly predictable.</li>
<li><strong>Why others are incorrect:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coronally Positioned Flap (CPF):</strong> This procedure
requires an adequate band (at least 3mm) of keratinized tissue apical to
the recession to be advanced coronally. A 5mm recession is very deep,
and it is highly unlikely that sufficient keratinized tissue remains,
making this procedure contraindicated.</li>
<li><strong>Free Gingival Graft (FGG):</strong> While it creates
keratinized tissue, it results in poor aesthetics (a “patchy” look) and
is not the primary choice for root coverage in the maxillary
anterior.</li>
<li><strong>Laterally Positioned Flap:</strong> This is only indicated
for single, narrow recession defects where there is adequate donor
tissue on an adjacent tooth. It is not suitable for multiple adjacent
teeth.</li>

for a patient with an unknown allergy to metabisulfite? A. Mepivacaine
2% B. Articaine 4% C. Lidocaine 2% <strong>D. Prilocaine 4%</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key to this question is knowing
which local anesthetic formulations are available <em>without</em> a
vasoconstrictor. Sodium metabisulfite is a preservative added only to
anesthetic cartridges that contain a vasoconstrictor (like epinephrine
or levonordefrin). A “plain” anesthetic does not contain
metabisulfite.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mepivacaine:</strong> The 2% solution contains
levonordefrin. The <strong>3% solution</strong> is plain.</li>
<li><strong>Articaine:</strong> The 4% solution always contains
epinephrine. There is no plain formulation.</li>
<li><strong>Lidocaine:</strong> The 2% solution always contains
epinephrine.</li>
<li><strong>Prilocaine:</strong> The <strong>4% solution</strong> is
available in two forms: one with epinephrine and one that is
<strong>plain</strong>.</li>

<p>A vital mandibular molar was recently restored with a full-coverage
crown. The patient returned a few days later with complaints of severe,
spontaneous pain that interferes with sleep. Which of the following is
the most appropriate next step? A. Adjust occlusion and reassess. B.
Remove the crown, place a temporary, and reassess. <strong>C. Initiate
endodontic therapy through the crown.</strong> D. Remove the crown,
complete endodontic therapy, and then fabricate a new crown.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
symptoms (severe, spontaneous pain, waking the patient from sleep) are
pathognomonic for <strong>irreversible pulpitis</strong>. *
<strong>Treatment:</strong> The definitive treatment for irreversible
pulpitis is root canal therapy. * <strong>Management Strategy:</strong>
The principle of “repair is better than replacement” applies. It is
standard and conservative practice to perform the root canal by creating
an access opening <strong>through the existing crown</strong>. Removing
a newly cemented, well-fitting crown is unnecessary, destructive to the
underlying tooth structure, and more costly for the patient. After the
root canal is complete, the access opening in the crown is restored with
a permanent filling material like composite.</p>

<h3 id="question-35">Question 35:</h3>
<p>Which of the following statements regarding implant-supported crowns
is true? A. Temporary cement should never be used to lute implant
crowns. B. Resin cements are the preferred luting agent for
implant-supported crowns. <strong>C. Screw-retained crowns are preferred
when the abutment height is limited.</strong> D. Custom abutments are
contraindicated when restoring a single implant.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Correct Statement
(C):</strong> A cement-retained crown relies on the height and taper of
the abutment for mechanical retention. If the interocclusal space is
limited, the abutment will be short, providing poor retention. In such
cases, a <strong>screw-retained crown</strong> is preferred because its
retention is mechanical (via the screw) and independent of abutment
height. * <strong>Why others are false:</strong> * <strong>(A)</strong>
<strong>Temporary cements are the preferred choice</strong> for implant
crowns. They allow for retrievability if the screw loosens or the crown
needs to be removed for any reason. They also make cleanup of excess
cement easier, reducing the risk of peri-implantitis. *
<strong>(B)</strong> <strong>Resin cements are generally
contraindicated.</strong> They create a very strong bond, making
retrieval nearly impossible, and are extremely difficult to clean from
the subgingival sulcus, making them a high risk for causing
cement-induced peri-implantitis. * <strong>(D)</strong> Custom abutments
are very commonly and effectively used for single implants to create an
ideal emergence profile and optimal margin placement.</p>

<p>A 55-year-old female patient presents with a diagnosis of a vertical
root fracture in tooth #17. Her medical history reveals that she has
been taking oral bisphosphonates for the past two years for the
management of osteoporosis. Which of the following is the most
appropriate management approach? <strong>A. Extract after consultation
with a medical physician.</strong> B. Ask the medical physician to stop
the bisphosphonate for two months, then extract. C. Ask the medical
physician to reduce the dose of bisphosphonate for two months, then
extract. D. Refer for apicoectomy and retrofill.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Dental Diagnosis:</strong> A
vertical root fracture has a hopeless prognosis. The tooth must be
extracted. Endodontic surgery is not a treatment for a VRF. *
<strong>Medical Consideration:</strong> The patient is taking a
<strong>low-dose oral bisphosphonate</strong>. * <strong>Guidelines for
Management:</strong> 1. For patients on low-dose oral bisphosphonates
for osteoporosis (less than 4 years, no other risk factors), there are
<strong>no required alterations to the treatment plan</strong>. The risk
of developing Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ) is
very low. 2. A “drug holiday” (stopping the medication) is <strong>not
effective or recommended</strong>. Bisphosphonates accumulate in bone
and have an extremely long half-life, so stopping the drug for a few
months does not significantly alter the risk. 3. The tooth must be
extracted. Consulting with the physician is a prudent step to confirm
the patient’s overall medical status but will not change the need for
the extraction.</p>

single booster dose. <strong>B. Repeat the three-dose series of the
vaccine.</strong> C. Test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). D.
Consider the worker immune and take no further action.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The CDC and public health guidelines
have a clear protocol for vaccine non-responders. 1. <strong>Initial
Non-response:</strong> If a person fails to develop adequate antibodies
after the first complete 3-dose series, the next step is to
<strong>repeat the entire 3-dose series</strong>. 2. <strong>Second
Non-response:</strong> After the second full series, the person is
re-tested. If they <em>still</em> lack immunity, they are then tested
for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to determine if they are a
chronic carrier of the virus. 3. <strong>Final Status:</strong> If the
HBsAg test is negative, the person is considered a true “non-responder”

<p>A patient presents with pain. Tooth #35 has a deep MOD composite
restoration and does not respond to a cold test. A pocket of 14mm is
evident on the buccal surface of the tooth. Which of the following is
the most appropriate initial management? A. Extraction of the tooth.
<strong>B. Root canal treatment.</strong> C. Crown lengthening and a new
crown. D. Guided tissue regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
combination of a non-vital tooth (no response to cold test) and a deep,
isolated pocket points to a <strong>primary endodontic lesion</strong>.
The infection from the necrotic pulp has drained out through the
periodontal ligament space, creating a sinus tract that mimics a deep
periodontal pocket. * <strong>Treatment Priority:</strong> The source of
the infection is the necrotic pulp inside the tooth. Therefore, the
primary and essential first step is to treat the source with
<strong>root canal therapy</strong>. * <strong>Prognosis:</strong> In
many cases, once the endodontic infection is eliminated, the deep
“pocket” (which is actually a fistula) will heal on its own. Periodontal
therapy is only considered after re-evaluating the site several months
after the root canal treatment is completed.</p>

<p>What effect does increasing the milliamperage (mA) have on an X-ray
image? A. Decreased film density <strong>B. Increased film
density</strong> C. Increased image contrast D. Decreased image
contrast</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Milliamperage (mA):</strong>
This setting controls the quantity of electrons flowing in the x-ray
tube, which in turn controls the <strong>quantity of x-ray
photons</strong> produced per unit of time. * <strong>Effect on
Image:</strong> An increase in mA produces more photons. More photons
striking the sensor or film will result in a <strong>darker</strong>
image. The overall degree of blackening on a radiograph is called
<strong>density</strong>. * <strong>Contrast:</strong> Image contrast
(the difference between light and dark areas) is primarily controlled by

mononucleosis</strong> D. Aplastic anemia</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a classic clinical
presentation, especially in this age group. * <strong>Infectious
Mononucleosis (Mono):</strong> Caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
it commonly presents with a triad of fever, pharyngitis (sore
throat/difficulty swallowing due to enlarged tonsils), and
lymphadenopathy. A key diagnostic sign frequently seen is
<strong>palatal petechiae</strong> (small, pinpoint red spots on the
soft palate). * <strong>Other Options:</strong> While conditions like
leukemia or aplastic anemia can cause petechiae due to low platelet
counts, they are not typically associated with the severe exudative
pharyngitis and tonsillar enlargement seen in mono. HHT causes distinct,
blanching telangiectasias, not petechiae.</p>

<p>During root canal treatment, an instrument separated. The fragment
was successfully bypassed, and the canal was fully obturated. A
follow-up a few months later revealed a new periapical radiolucency. The
patient is asymptomatic. What is the most appropriate management? A.
Monitor in 6 months. B. Conventional endodontic retreatment. <strong>C.
Carry out an apicoectomy and retrofill of the affected root.</strong> D.
Extraction of the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
development of a <em>new</em> radiolucency after treatment is a sign of
<strong>post-treatment disease</strong>, or a failed root canal. *
<strong>Treatment Options:</strong> * <strong>Monitoring (A):</strong>
This is incorrect. A new, developing lesion is a sign of active
infection and must be treated. * <strong>Retreatment (B):</strong>
Conventional retreatment is the first choice <em>if</em> the original
treatment is deficient (e.g., short fill, missed canals) and the canals
are accessible. However, in this case, there is a separated instrument
at the apex. Attempting to remove it via a coronal approach is highly
risky and often unsuccessful. Since the file was already bypassed and
the canal obturated, retreatment offers little benefit. *
<strong>Apicoectomy (C):</strong> This is the most appropriate
management. Surgical endodontics (apicoectomy with retrofill) allows the
clinician to access the apex directly, remove the apical tip of the root
along with the separated instrument fragment, and seal the canal system
from the apex (retrograde). This addresses the source of the failure
without disturbing the existing crown and post/core. *
<strong>Extraction (D):</strong> This is too aggressive. The tooth is
restorable and can be saved with surgical intervention.</p>

<h3 id="question-42">Question 42:</h3>
<p>Tooth #26 of a 9-year-old patient has pronounced, deep, stained
occlusal fissures. A bitewing radiograph shows a normal dentinoenamel
junction (DEJ). What is the most appropriate management? A. Preventive
resin restoration (PRR) <strong>B. Application of fissure
sealants.</strong> C. Topical fluoride application every 3 months. D. No
treatment is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The key
findings are “deep stained fissures” and a “normal DEJ” on the
radiograph. This means there is no radiographic evidence of caries
penetrating into the dentin. The staining is in the fissure, but there
is no cavitation or demineralization into dentin. *
<strong>Treatment:</strong> This is the classic indication for a
<strong>fissure sealant</strong>. Sealants are a preventive measure used
to seal deep, non-carious pits and fissures that are at high risk for
developing decay. * <strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> * <strong>PRR
(A):</strong> This is a restorative procedure indicated when there is a
small, cavitated carious lesion confined to the enamel or just into the
dentin. Since there is no caries into dentin here, a PRR is too
invasive. * <strong>Fluoride (C):</strong> While helpful, it doesn’t
physically block the deep fissures from plaque accumulation like a
sealant does. * <strong>No treatment (D):</strong> This is inappropriate
given the “pronounced deep” fissures, which represent a high-risk
morphology.</p>

<p>A 12-year-old asthmatic patient is having a restoration done.
Following local anesthesia, the patient begins wheezing and complains of
difficulty breathing. What is the most appropriate immediate management?
A. Terminate the procedure and administer epinephrine. B. Terminate the
procedure and encourage the patient to breathe into a paper bag.
<strong>C. Terminate the procedure and administer a beta-2 agonist
inhaler (e.g., Salbutamol).</strong> D. Terminate the procedure and
immediately activate 911.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
patient is having an <strong>acute asthma attack</strong>. *
<strong>Immediate Management:</strong> The first-line treatment for an
acute asthma attack is the administration of a rapid-acting
<strong>bronchodilator</strong>. This is typically a <strong>beta-2
agonist inhaler</strong> (e.g., Salbutamol/Albuterol/Ventolin), which
the patient should have with them. This medication relaxes the smooth
muscles of the airways, relieving the bronchospasm. * <strong>Incorrect
Options:</strong> * <strong>Epinephrine (A):</strong> This is a
second-line treatment, used only if the patient does not respond to the
inhaler or if the attack is life-threatening. * <strong>Paper Bag
(B):</strong> This is the treatment for hyperventilation, not asthma. It
would worsen the hypoxia in an asthma attack. * <strong>Activate 911
(D):</strong> This should be done, but only <em>after</em> administering
the first-line treatment. The most appropriate <em>immediate</em> step
is to provide the bronchodilator.</p>

<h3 id="question-44">Question 44:</h3>
<p>In the management of metabolic acidosis due to aspirin overdose,
urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate is employed primarily for
which of the following reasons? <strong>A. To reduce the renal tubular
reabsorption of aspirin.</strong> B. To increase the renal tubular
reabsorption of aspirin. C. To decrease the ionization of aspirin in the
renal tubules. D. To correct the systemic metabolic acidosis
directly.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is another application of the
principle of drug ionization and excretion. * <strong>Aspirin:</strong>
Is a weak acid (acetylsalicylic acid). * <strong>Renal
Excretion:</strong> To be excreted in the urine, a drug must remain in
its <strong>ionized</strong> form, as this form is water-soluble and
cannot easily be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the lipid
membranes of the renal tubules. * <strong>Mechanism:</strong> 1. By
administering sodium bicarbonate, the urine is made more
<strong>alkaline</strong>. 2. In an alkaline environment, the weak acid
(aspirin) will be predominantly in its <strong>ionized</strong> form. 3.
This “traps” the aspirin in the renal tubules, preventing it from being
reabsorbed back into the body. 4. The result is a significant
<strong>increase in the excretion</strong> of aspirin from the body. *
Therefore, the primary reason for alkalinizing the urine is to reduce
renal tubular reabsorption by increasing ionization.</p>

<p>Which surgical technique is most suitable to treat a high frenal
attachment with a wide base for a patient wanting to get dentures soon?
A. Simple excision B. Z-plasty <strong>C. Localized vestibuloplasty with
secondary epithelialization.</strong> D. Labial notch in the denture
base.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The choice of frenectomy technique
depends on the morphology of the frenum. * <strong>Narrow-based
frenum:</strong> A simple excision or a Z-plasty is effective. A
Z-plasty is superior as it lengthens the tissue and reduces scar
contracture. * <strong>Wide-based frenum:</strong> When the frenum has a
wide, fan-shaped base inserting into the vestibule, simply excising it
is not enough. A <strong>localized vestibuloplasty with secondary
epithelialization</strong> is the indicated procedure. This technique
involves dissecting away the muscle fibers over a broad area and
suturing the mucosal edge higher up in the vestibule, effectively
deepening the vestibule and eliminating the broad pull of the frenum.
The exposed periosteum then heals by secondary intention. * A labial
notch in the denture is a way to <em>accommodate</em> a frenum, not
treat it.</p>

<h3 id="question-46">Question 46:</h3>
<p>A patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with
obstruction of the submandibular duct. Which of the following is the
most appropriate initial imaging technique? A. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) B.
Panoramic radiograph <strong>C. Mandibular standard occlusal
radiograph</strong> D. Sialography</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Condition:</strong> The
likely cause of obstruction is a sialolith (salivary stone). *
<strong>Location:</strong> The submandibular duct (Wharton’s duct) runs
along the floor of the mouth. * <strong>Imaging:</strong> The best and
simplest initial radiograph to visualize the floor of the mouth and the
path of Wharton’s duct is a <strong>mandibular standard occlusal
radiograph</strong>. It provides a clear view without superimposition
and can readily show radiopaque sialoliths. * <strong>Incorrect
Options:</strong> * <strong>CBCT</strong> would work but is too much
radiation and cost for an initial investigation. *
<strong>Panoramic</strong> radiographs are poor for visualizing the
floor of the mouth due to superimposition of the mandible. They are
useful for stones in the parotid gland. * <strong>Sialography</strong>
is an invasive technique involving injecting contrast dye and is used
for investigating ductal pathology, but not as the first-line imaging
for a suspected stone.</p>

<h3 id="question-47">Question 47:</h3>
<p>Which of the following best explains why artificial teeth should not
be placed over the ascending portion of the mandibular ramus in complete
denture fabrication? A. The denture base terminates before the ascending
ramus. B. The teeth would interfere with the retromolar pad. C. The
teeth would encroach on the tongue space. <strong>D. Occlusal forces on
the inclined ramus would dislodge the mandibular denture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The placement of denture teeth must
follow biomechanical principles to ensure stability. * <strong>The
Problem:</strong> The ascending ramus is an inclined plane. *
<strong>The Force:</strong> Occlusal forces are directed primarily
vertically. * <strong>The Result:</strong> If a denture tooth is placed
on this incline, any vertical occlusal force will be resolved into
components: one vertical and one <strong>anteriorly-directed horizontal
force</strong>. This horizontal force will act to push the entire
mandibular denture forward and dislodge it. To maintain stability,
denture teeth must be placed on the horizontal portion of the residual
ridge only. * <strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> * (A) The denture base
<em>should</em> extend onto the retromolar pad, which is at the base of
the ascending ramus, for support. * (B) The teeth are placed
<em>anterior</em> to the ascending ramus; they don’t interfere with the
retromolar pad itself. * (C) The ascending ramus is too far posterior to
interfere with the main body of the tongue space.</p>

<p>You have designed a mandibular Kennedy Class I RPD with rests on #34
and #44. What change creates a destructive first-class lever system? A.
Adding indirect retainers on #33 and #43. B. Using mesial rests with
I-bar clasps. <strong>C. Placing a distal occlusal rest and a
circumferential clasp on the abutment.</strong> D. Using a wrought-wire
clasp.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a distal extension RPD (Class I),
the goal is to <em>avoid</em> a Class I lever, which is destructive to
the abutment tooth. * <strong>Lever System Components:</strong> *
<strong>Fulcrum (F):</strong> The most posterior rest on the abutment
tooth. * <strong>Resistance (R):</strong> The retentive clasp tip
resisting dislodgement. * <strong>Effort (E):</strong> The force applied
on the denture base during function. * <strong>Class I Lever:</strong>
The fulcrum is between the effort and the resistance (E-F-R). This
magnifies the force applied to the retentive clasp, torquing the
abutment tooth. * <strong>How to Create a Class I Lever (C):</strong>
Placing a <strong>distal rest (F)</strong> and a <strong>buccal
circumferential clasp (R)</strong> on the same tooth creates this
destructive lever. When the denture base is pushed down (E), the
framework pivots on the distal rest (F), causing the rigid clasp tip (R)
to be torqued upwards and distally against the tooth. * <strong>How to
Avoid a Class I Lever (B):</strong> Using a <strong>mesial rest</strong>
changes the configuration to a Class II lever (F-R-E), which is
non-destructive. The RPI system (Rest on mesial, Plate on lingual, I-bar
on buccal) is designed specifically to achieve this.</p>

<h3 id="question-49">Question 49:</h3>
<p>Premature exfoliation of the primary mandibular canines is most
commonly associated with which of the following conditions? A. Early
childhood caries B. Trauma C. Serial extraction therapy <strong>D. Arch
length deficiency</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a classic sign of developing
crowding. * <strong>Mechanism:</strong> When the permanent mandibular
incisors erupt, they are significantly larger than the primary incisors
they replace. If there is insufficient space in the arch (<strong>arch
length deficiency</strong>), the erupting permanent lateral incisors
will have their roots positioned against the roots of the adjacent
primary canines. * <strong>Result:</strong> The pressure from the
erupting laterals causes resorption of the primary canine roots, leading
to their <strong>premature exfoliation</strong>. * This is an important
diagnostic sign that signals significant crowding is present and that
the permanent canines will likely be blocked out of the arch. *
<strong>Incorrect Option C:</strong> Serial extraction is a
<em>treatment</em> for arch length deficiency; it is not the
<em>cause</em> of the premature exfoliation. The deficiency itself is
the root cause.</p>

<p>A case-control study shows that smoking is associated with a relative
risk of 2.5 for oral leukoplakia. The study includes only hospitalized
patients. What is the primary concern with this study? A. Recall bias
<strong>B. Selection bias</strong> C. Confounding bias D. Surveillance
bias</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>The Flaw:</strong> The study
population is restricted to <strong>hospitalized patients</strong>. *
<strong>Selection Bias:</strong> This is the primary concern.
Hospitalized patients are not representative of the general population.
They are sicker and may have different smoking habits, comorbidities, or
other characteristics compared to non-hospitalized individuals. Using
this group to draw conclusions about the general population introduces
selection bias, which threatens the <strong>external validity</strong>
(generalizability) of the study’s findings. * <strong>Other
Biases:</strong> * Confounding is possible (e.g., hospitalized patients
may also drink more alcohol), but the most fundamental flaw in the study
design itself is the non-representative selection of the sample. *
Recall and surveillance biases are not the main issues described.</p>

<p>A simple hinge articulator can be used to detect which of the
following interferences? A. Working side interferences B. Non-working
side interferences <strong>C. Incisor interferences (in
centric)</strong> D. None of the above</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Simple Hinge
Articulator:</strong> This type of articulator only allows for a simple
opening and closing motion around a fixed hinge. It
<strong>cannot</strong> reproduce lateral (side-to-side) or protrusive
movements. * <strong>Interference Detection:</strong> * Because it
cannot perform lateral movements, it <strong>cannot detect working or
non-working side interferences</strong>. * Because it cannot perform
protrusive movements, it cannot detect protrusive interferences. * It
can only detect interferences that occur during the final arc of closure
into maximum intercuspation. These are called <strong>centric
interferences</strong>. An incisor interference that prevents the
posterior teeth from occluding in centric <em>can</em> be detected on a
simple hinge articulator.</p>

<h3 id="question-52">Question 52:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is an advantage of a removable functional
appliance (e.g., Twin Block) over a fixed functional appliance (e.g.,
Herbst)? A. They allow the simultaneous use of orthodontic brackets. B.
They hold the mandible in a protrusive position to stimulate condylar
growth. <strong>C. They allow selective guided eruption of posterior
teeth.</strong> D. They do not require good patient compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Correct Advantage
(C):</strong> Removable appliances like the Twin Block have acrylic that
covers the occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth. By selectively
grinding away the acrylic over certain teeth (e.g., the lower molars),
the clinician can <strong>guide their eruption</strong> vertically. This
is a powerful tool for correcting deep bites by allowing the posterior
teeth to erupt and “open” the bite. This cannot be done with a fixed
appliance like the Herbst. * <strong>Why others are incorrect:</strong>
* <strong>(A)</strong> Fixed appliances (Herbst) are used simultaneously
with brackets. Removable appliances generally are not. *
<strong>(B)</strong> <em>Both</em> types of appliances hold the mandible
forward to stimulate growth; this is their shared function, not an
advantage of one over the other. * <strong>(D)</strong> Removable
appliances require <strong>excellent patient compliance</strong>,
whereas fixed appliances are non-removable and work 24/7, making them
compliance-free. This is a major advantage of fixed appliances, not
removable ones.</p>

<p>A patient was treated for Stage III, Grade B periodontitis. After
Phase I therapy, they return with no bleeding, but still have some 5mm
pockets. What is the most appropriate periodontal diagnosis at this
point? A. Gingival health on a reduced periodontium B. Stage I, Grade A
periodontitis <strong>C. Stage III, Grade B periodontitis,
stable.</strong> D. Stage II, Grade B periodontitis</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question tests the 2017
classification of periodontal diseases. * <strong>Staging Does Not
Regress:</strong> The <strong>Stage</strong> of periodontitis is based
on the severity of disease at its worst point, primarily determined by
the maximum amount of historical bone loss and attachment loss. This
damage is largely irreversible. Therefore, a patient diagnosed with
Stage III will <strong>always remain a Stage III patient</strong> (or
progress to Stage IV). The stage cannot be retrograded to Stage II or I.
The goal of treatment is to make the disease stable. * <strong>Grading
Can Change:</strong> The <strong>Grade</strong> reflects the rate of
progression and presence of risk factors (like smoking or diabetes). If
risk factors are controlled, the grade can improve (e.g., from C to B,
or B to A). In this case, no information suggests the grade has changed.
* <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The patient was Stage III, Grade B. After
successful initial therapy, they are now a <strong>stable Stage III,
Grade B periodontitis patient</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="question-54">Question 54:</h3>
<p>The potency of a local anesthetic is primarily influenced by which of
the following factors? A. Protein binding B. pKa <strong>C. Lipid
solubility</strong> D. pH of the tissue</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The intrinsic properties of a local
anesthetic molecule determine its clinical characteristics. *
<strong>Potency (C):</strong> Potency is determined by <strong>lipid
solubility</strong>. The nerve membrane is a lipid bilayer. A more
lipid-soluble drug can more easily penetrate this membrane to reach its
site of action (sodium channels) inside the nerve. Therefore, higher
lipid solubility equals higher potency. * <strong>Duration (A):</strong>
Duration of action is primarily determined by <strong>protein
binding</strong>. Once inside the nerve, the drug binds to proteins near
the sodium channel. A higher degree of protein binding keeps the drug at
the site of action for longer, increasing its duration. * <strong>Onset
(B):</strong> Onset of action is primarily determined by
<strong>pKa</strong>. A drug’s pKa determines the proportion of ionized
vs. non-ionized molecules at physiologic pH. The non-ionized (base) form
is what crosses the nerve membrane. A pKa closer to physiologic pH means
more base molecules are available, leading to a faster onset.</p>

<p>In normal maximum intercuspation, the mesial marginal ridge of a
maxillary second premolar contacts which of the following? A. Distal
marginal ridge of the mandibular first premolar. <strong>B. Distal
marginal ridge of the mandibular second premolar.</strong> C. Mesial
marginal ridge of the mandibular first molar. D. Central fossa of the
mandibular second premolar.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This requires knowledge of normal
occlusal relationships. In a Class I occlusion, each maxillary tooth
occludes with its mandibular counterpart and the tooth distal to it,
with two exceptions. * The general rule is that a specific cusp or ridge
of a maxillary tooth will contact the corresponding feature on the
mandibular tooth that is one tooth “ahead” of it numerically. *
Following this pattern, the <strong>mesial marginal ridge of the
maxillary second premolar (#15 or #25)</strong> will occlude with the
<strong>distal marginal ridge of the mandibular second premolar (#45 or
#35)</strong>. * Drawing a “picket fence” diagram is a helpful way to
visualize these relationships.</p>

<p>Which of the following is true regarding a Process Challenge Device
(PCD) used in the sterilization process? A. It should be used only in
the first sterilization cycle of the day. B. It allows for the removal
of air from the sterilizer to allow steam penetration. <strong>C. It
should be used with a chemical indicator of Type 5 or 6, and/or a
biological indicator in the center of the device.</strong> D. It is only
required for sterilizers that use a vacuum cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A PCD is designed to be the most
difficult item to sterilize in a load, thus “challenging” the
sterilization process. * <strong>Correct Statement (C):</strong> A PCD,
whether commercially made or created in-house, must contain a
sterilization monitor deep inside it. This should be a high-level
<strong>Type 5 or 6 chemical indicator</strong> (which integrates time,
temperature, and steam) and/or a <strong>biological indicator</strong>
(spore test). If this indicator inside the most challenging device
changes appropriately, it gives confidence that everything else in the
load was also sterilized. * <strong>Why others are false:</strong> *
<strong>(A)</strong> A PCD is used in <strong>every sterilization
cycle</strong>, not just the first one. The first cycle of the day must
contain a PCD with a <em>biological indicator</em>. Subsequent cycles
must contain a PCD with a <em>chemical indicator</em>. *
<strong>(B)</strong> This describes the function of a pre-vacuum cycle
in an autoclave. A test called the Bowie-Dick test is used to check the
efficacy of the air removal, which is different from a PCD. * This
question was noted as flawed because another option (related to its use
in the first cycle) was also presented as correct in the transcript, but

<p>Which of the following statements is true regarding
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in endodontic infections? A. They are
potent endotoxins produced by gram-positive bacteria. <strong>B. They
are susceptible to inactivation by calcium hydroxide.</strong> C. They
cause inflammation, but not periapical inflammation. D. They stimulate
osteoblast activation.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> LPS is a major virulence factor in
endodontic disease. * <strong>Correct Statement (B):</strong> Calcium
hydroxide is a commonly used intracanal medicament precisely because of
its ability to inactivate LPS. The very high pH (alkalinity) of calcium
hydroxide hydrolyzes and detoxifies the Lipid A portion of the LPS
molecule, which is responsible for its inflammatory effects. *
<strong>Why others are false:</strong> * <strong>(A)</strong> LPS is a
component of the outer membrane of <strong>gram-negative
bacteria</strong>, not gram-positive. * <strong>(C)</strong> LPS is a
powerful inflammatory mediator that is a primary cause of
<strong>periapical inflammation</strong> and bone resorption. *
<strong>(D)</strong> LPS stimulates an inflammatory cascade that leads
to <strong>osteoclast</strong> activation (bone resorption), not
osteoblast activation (bone formation).</p>

<p>If an orthodontic bracket is placed too gingivally on the buccal
surface of a tooth, it will most likely result in: A. Intrusion and
lingual tipping B. Intrusion and buccal tipping C. Extrusion and buccal
tipping <strong>D. Extrusion and lingual tipping</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The archwire always tries to straighten
and level itself. The position of the bracket relative to the tooth’s
center of resistance determines the movement. * <strong>Bracket placed
too gingivally:</strong> The archwire sits gingival to its ideal path.
To straighten out, the wire will apply an <strong>extrusive
force</strong> to the tooth, pulling it down into the line of the
archwire. * <strong>Tipping:</strong> Since the force is applied
gingival to the center of resistance, it will also create a moment that
causes the crown to tip. An extrusive force applied to the buccal
surface will cause the crown to tip <strong>lingually</strong>. *
<strong>The reverse:</strong> If the bracket were placed too incisally,
it would cause intrusion and buccal tipping.</p>

clear-to-brown liquid with a strong ammonia odor. D. It causes
discoloration of the treated tooth structure.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The question asks for the
<strong>false</strong> statement. * <strong>Statement B is
False:</strong> The statement claims SDF is “not effective” on
non-cavitated lesions. This is incorrect. While its most dramatic use is
in arresting cavitated lesions, SDF is also highly effective at
arresting <strong>non-cavitated</strong> incipient lesions due to the
high concentration of both silver (antimicrobial) and fluoride
(remineralizing). Therefore, the statement that it is <em>not
effective</em> is false. * <strong>Why others are true:</strong> * (A)

<h3 id="question-60">Question 60:</h3>
<p>The mother of a 6-year-old child is concerned about a “double row” of
teeth in the lower front. The permanent mandibular central incisors are
erupting lingual to the primary centrals, which are mobile and have ~1/4
of their root remaining. There is no crowding. What is the most
appropriate management? <strong>A. Reassure the parent that this is a
normal variation of eruption.</strong> B. Extract the primary central
incisors. C. Place an appliance to push the permanent teeth labially. D.
Monitor for 6 months, then extract if not resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a very common clinical
scenario. * <strong>Eruption Pattern:</strong> It is very common for the
permanent mandibular incisors to erupt lingually to the primary
incisors. * <strong>Key Positive Signs:</strong> The primary teeth are
<strong>mobile</strong> and show significant <strong>root
resorption</strong>. This indicates that the natural exfoliation process
is proceeding normally. * <strong>Management:</strong> In the absence of
crowding, and when the primary teeth are mobile, no intervention is
necessary. The pressure from the tongue will typically guide the
permanent incisors forward into their correct position after the primary
teeth exfoliate. * <strong>Guidelines:</strong> Intervention (extraction
of the primary teeth) is generally only considered if the condition
persists past the age of <strong>7.5 years</strong>, or if the primary
teeth show no signs of resorption or mobility, preventing the permanent
teeth from moving into place. Since the child is 6, it is far too early
to intervene.</p>

<p>A study examined individuals of low socioeconomic status and their
complaints about the high cost of dentistry. The odds ratio (OR) was
1.45 with a 95% confidence interval of (1.2 - 1.8). Which is the most
appropriate interpretation? A. There is a 45% increase in individuals of
low socioeconomic status to complain about the high cost of dentistry.
B. There is a 55% decrease in individuals of low socioeconomic status to
complain about the high cost of dentistry. C. There is a 145% increase
in individuals of low socioeconomic status to complain about the high
cost of dentistry. D. The results are not statistically significant.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Interpreting an odds ratio (OR)
involves two steps: assessing significance and quantifying the effect.
1. <strong>Statistical Significance:</strong> The 95% confidence
interval (1.2 to 1.8) <strong>does not include 1.0</strong>. This means
the result is statistically significant. 2. <strong>Direction of
Association:</strong> The OR is 1.45, which is <strong>greater than
1.0</strong>. This indicates a <strong>positive association</strong>,
meaning the “exposed” group (low socioeconomic status) is <em>more
likely</em> to have the outcome (complain about cost). 3.
<strong>Quantifying the Increase:</strong> To convert the OR to a
percentage increase, the formula is: * Percentage Increase = (OR - 1) ×
100 * Percentage Increase = (1.45 - 1) × 100 * Percentage Increase =
0.45 × 100 = <strong>45%</strong></p>

<p>A metal framework for an RPD is returned from the lab. During try-in
on the master cast, it rocks and only fully seats on one side. What is
the most likely cause? A. Inaccurate final impression B. Inaccurate
occlusal record C. Distortion of the impression material <strong>D.
Distortion of the metal framework during processing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key is to determine if the error
occurred in the clinic (dentist’s fault) or the lab. * <strong>The
Test:</strong> The framework <strong>does not fit the master
cast</strong>. * <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The master cast is the
direct positive replica of the final impression. If the framework
doesn’t fit the cast it was made on, then the error occurred
<em>after</em> the cast was created. This points directly to a
laboratory error. The most likely cause is that the <strong>metal
framework itself was warped or distorted during the casting, finishing,
or polishing procedures in the lab</strong>. *
<strong>Contrast:</strong> If the framework fit the master cast
perfectly but did not fit in the patient’s mouth, the error would most
likely be a distorted impression or an inaccurate cast, which is the
dentist’s responsibility.</p>

<p>All of the following are expected to cause hypokalemia (low
potassium) EXCEPT: <strong>A. Metabolic acidosis</strong> B. Increased
plasma insulin C. Excess aldosterone secretion D. Beta-adrenergic
stimulation of cells</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question asks which condition
causes hyperkalemia (high potassium), while the others cause
hypokalemia. * <strong>Metabolic Acidosis (A):</strong> In an acidotic
state, there is an excess of hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood. To buffer
this, H+ ions move from the blood into the body’s cells. To maintain
electrical neutrality, potassium ions (K+) must then move <strong>out of
the cells</strong> and into the blood. This shift results in
<strong>hyperkalemia</strong>. * <strong>Causes of Hypokalemia (B, C,
D):</strong> * <strong>Insulin (B):</strong> Insulin stimulates the
Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which actively drives potassium
<strong>into</strong> cells, lowering plasma potassium. *
<strong>Aldosterone (C):</strong> Aldosterone acts on the kidneys to
increase sodium reabsorption and <strong>increase potassium
excretion</strong>, leading to potassium loss from the body. *
<strong>Beta-adrenergic stimulation (D):</strong> Similar to insulin,
stimulating beta-2 receptors activates the Na+/K+ pump, shifting
potassium <strong>into</strong> cells.</p>

<p>A patient returns three months after a traumatic surgical extraction
of #38 complaining of persistent numbness on the lateral side of the
tongue. Which of the following is the most appropriate management? A.
Prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. B. Initiate nerve
mapping to establish a baseline. C. Take a cone-beam CT scan. <strong>D.
Assess the patient for nerve grafting/surgical repair.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The timing of the patient’s
presentation is the critical factor. * <strong>The Situation:</strong>
The patient presents <strong>three months post-op</strong> with
<strong>persistent numbness</strong> and no indication of improvement.
The window for spontaneous recovery or simple monitoring has passed. *
<strong>Management at 3 Months:</strong> * <strong>Nerve Mapping
Baseline (B):</strong> It is too late to establish a “baseline.” A
baseline should have been taken immediately post-op. At three months,
the lack of improvement is the key finding. * <strong>Corticosteroids
(A):</strong> These are used to manage acute inflammation in the
immediate post-op period. They will have no effect on a potential nerve
transection three months later. * <strong>Surgical Intervention
(D):</strong> Three months of persistent, severe anesthesia with no
improvement is a strong indication of significant nerve damage, likely a
neuroma or complete transection (neurotmesis). At this point, the
patient should be evaluated for microsurgical nerve repair to have any
chance of regaining function. This is the only proactive treatment
option left.</p>

<h3 id="question-66">Question 66:</h3>
<p>A maxillary canine is planned to receive a full-coverage crown with
subgingival margins. There are no signs of inflammation, but there is
only 1mm of attached gingiva. Which is the most appropriate procedure
prior to crown placement? A. Root planing B. Coronally positioned flap
C. Localized gingivectomy <strong>D. Autogenous connective tissue
graft</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Placing a subgingival restoration
margin requires an adequate zone of keratinized/attached gingiva to
withstand the restorative trauma and maintain health. This is known as
“biotype modification.” * <strong>The Guideline:</strong> A minimum of
3mm of attached gingiva and 5mm of total keratinized gingiva is
recommended when placing subgingival margins. * <strong>The
Problem:</strong> This patient only has 1mm of attached gingiva, which
is insufficient. * <strong>The Solution:</strong> A procedure is needed
to <strong>increase the zone of attached gingiva</strong>. * An
<strong>autogenous connective tissue graft (or a free gingival
graft)</strong> is the procedure of choice for this purpose. It involves
transplanting keratinized tissue from the palate to the recipient site
to widen the band of attached gingiva. * <strong>Incorrect
Options:</strong> A gingivectomy <em>removes</em> gingiva. A coronally
positioned flap <em>moves</em> existing gingiva but does not create
more, and is contraindicated with insufficient keratinized tissue.</p>

<p>Which statement is correct regarding anxiolytic and hypnotic agents?
A. Phenobarbital shows analgesic properties. B. Barbiturates are
contraindicated in acute intermittent porphyria. C. Diazepam is a
microsomal enzyme inducer. D. Zaleplon is metabolized by the cytochrome
P450 system.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Correct Statement
(B):</strong> Barbiturates (like phenobarbital) are known to induce the
ALA synthase enzyme. In patients with acute intermittent porphyria, this
induction exacerbates the condition by increasing the production of
porphyrin precursors, which can trigger a life-threatening attack. This
is an absolute contraindication. * <strong>Why others are
false:</strong> * <strong>(A)</strong> Barbiturates have sedative and
hypnotic properties but <strong>no analgesic properties</strong>. They
can even increase the perception of pain (anti-analgesic). *
<strong>(C)</strong> Diazepam (a benzodiazepine) is <em>metabolized</em>
by the P450 system, but it is not a significant inducer. Barbiturates
are the classic potent enzyme inducers. * <strong>(D)</strong> This
statement is also true, Zaleplon is metabolized by P450. The instructor
likely accepted B as the intended key answer because it represents a
critical clinical contraindication, a more common testing point.

<p>Which statement regarding enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) used in
periodontal regeneration is correct? A. They can only be used in
conjunction with a membrane. <strong>B. They have been shown to be
effective in cementum regeneration.</strong> C. Significant bone fill is
evident in cases of horizontal bone loss. D. All of the above.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> EMD (e.g., Emdogain) is a biologic
agent used to stimulate periodontal regeneration. * <strong>Correct
Statement (B):</strong> Histologic studies have confirmed that EMD
effectively stimulates the regeneration of all parts of the
periodontium, including <strong>new cementum</strong>, new alveolar
bone, and a new periodontal ligament. Its ability to promote cementum
formation is a key part of achieving true regeneration. * <strong>Why
others are false:</strong> * <strong>(A)</strong> The addition of a
barrier membrane <strong>confers no additional benefit</strong> when
using EMD. EMD works by stimulating cellular differentiation, a
different mechanism than the space maintenance provided by a membrane in
GTR. * <strong>(C)</strong> Periodontal regeneration techniques,
including EMD, are only effective for treating <strong>vertical or
infrabony defects</strong>. They are <strong>not effective</strong> for

<p>A patient is having a root canal done. After placement of a rubber
dam, the patient develops a rash, flushing, and angioedema. What is the
most likely diagnosis? A. Vasovagal syncope B. Delayed-type
hypersensitivity <strong>C. Rapid-onset skin reaction (Type I
Hypersensitivity)</strong> D. Anaphylactic reaction</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
patient is experiencing an acute allergic reaction. The signs (rash,
flushing, angioedema) are classic manifestations. The key is the timing
and the systems involved. * <strong>Timing:</strong> The reaction
happened immediately after the placement of the rubber dam, suggesting
an allergy to latex. * <strong>Type of Reaction:</strong> * This is a
<strong>Type I (Immediate) Hypersensitivity reaction</strong>. It is a
rapid-onset skin reaction. * It is <strong>not an anaphylactic
reaction</strong> because there are no signs of respiratory (e.g.,
wheezing, bronchospasm) or cardiovascular (e.g., hypotension,
tachycardia) collapse mentioned. Anaphylaxis is a systemic,
life-threatening Type I reaction. * It is <strong>not contact

<p>What is the primary cause of an anterior open bite in a patient with
a Le Fort I fracture? <strong>A. Posterior and inferior displacement of
the maxilla due to pull from the pterygoid muscles.</strong> B. Upward
traction of the maxilla by the muscles of facial expression. C. Downward
and backward rotation of the mandible by the infrahyoid muscles. D.
Fracture of the mandibular condyles.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Le Fort I Fracture:</strong>
This is a horizontal fracture that separates the maxilla (from the nasal
floor down) from the rest of the midface. * <strong>Muscle
Pull:</strong> The medial and lateral pterygoid muscles originate from
the skull base and insert onto the mandible and the fractured maxillary
segment. When the maxilla is fractured, the powerful pull of these
muscles displaces the now-mobile segment <strong>downward and backward
(inferiorly and posteriorly)</strong>. * <strong>Occlusal
Result:</strong> This displacement causes the posterior maxillary teeth
to contact the mandibular teeth prematurely, leaving a gap in the
anterior. This is clinically evident as an <strong>anterior open
bite</strong>. The muscles of facial expression (B) are too weak to
cause this bony movement.</p>

<p>A leukemic patient received a bone marrow transplant 20 days ago. He
presents with an erythematous buccal mucosa. Which of the following
should NOT be considered as a differential diagnosis? A.
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection
<strong>C. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</strong> D.
Candidiasis</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key is understanding the patient’s
immune status. * <strong>Patient Status:</strong> A patient who has just
received a bone marrow transplant is <strong>profoundly
immunosuppressed</strong>, both from their underlying leukemia and from
the high-dose chemo/radiation used to ablate their old marrow. *
<strong>Differential Diagnosis for Oral Lesions:</strong> * <strong>GVHD
(A):</strong> This is a very common complication where the new, donor
immune cells attack the recipient’s tissues. The oral mucosa is a
frequent target. * <strong>HSV (B) and Candidiasis (D):</strong> These
are opportunistic infections that flourish in an immunosuppressed host.
* <strong>SLE (C):</strong> Systemic lupus erythematosus is an
<strong>autoimmune disease</strong>, where the body’s own immune system
becomes hyperactive and attacks itself. This condition would be
suppressed, not caused, by the profound immunosuppression the patient is
undergoing. Therefore, SLE should not be considered in the differential
diagnosis.</p>

<p>Damage to the trochlear nerve nucleus will result in which of the
following deficits? A. Ipsilateral paralysis of the superior oblique
muscle. <strong>B. Contralateral paralysis of the superior oblique
muscle.</strong> C. Ipsilateral paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle.
D. Contralateral paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The trochlear nerve (Cranial Nerve IV)
has a unique anatomical path. * <strong>Function:</strong> It innervates
a single muscle: the <strong>superior oblique muscle</strong> of the
eye. * <strong>Unique Feature:</strong> The axons from the trochlear
nerve nucleus <strong>decussate (cross over to the opposite
side)</strong> within the brainstem before they exit. * <strong>Clinical
Implication:</strong> * A lesion of the <strong>trochlear nerve
nucleus</strong> on one side will cause paralysis of the superior
oblique muscle on the <strong>contralateral (opposite)</strong> side. *
A lesion of the <strong>trochlear nerve itself</strong> (after it has
exited the brainstem) will cause paralysis on the <strong>ipsilateral

<p>Changes in the arch length of the mandible during the transition from
primary to permanent dentition will be in the form of: A. An increase of
2-3 mm <strong>B. A decrease of 2-3 mm</strong> C. An increase of 6 mm
D. No significant change</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Arch length (or depth) is the distance
from a midpoint between the central incisors to a line tangent to the
distal surfaces of the second primary molars. * <strong>Mandibular
Arch:</strong> In the mandible, the space gained from the permanent
incisors being more proclined is not enough to offset the space lost due
to the mesial drift of the permanent first molars into the
<strong>leeway space</strong>. * <strong>Leeway Space:</strong> This is
the size difference between the primary canine/molars and the permanent
canine/premolars that replace them. The mandibular leeway space is
approximately 2.5 mm per side. * <strong>Net Result:</strong> As the
permanent molars drift mesially to close this space, the overall arch
length decreases by an average of <strong>2-3 mm</strong>.</p>

surgery. The affected nerve enters the skull through which of the
following foramina? A. Foramen spinosum B. Foramen rotundum <strong>C.
Foramen ovale</strong> D. Jugular foramen</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The question requires identifying the
nerve responsible and its cranial exit point. * <strong>Nerve
Identification:</strong> * Numbness of the lower lip and chin is due to
injury to the <strong>mental nerve/inferior alveolar nerve</strong>. *
Numbness (general sensation) of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue is due to
injury to the <strong>lingual nerve</strong>. * <strong>Cranial Nerve
Origin:</strong> Both the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve
are branches of the <strong>mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve
(V3)</strong>. * <strong>Cranial Foramen:</strong> The mandibular nerve
(V3) exits the skull through the <strong>foramen ovale</strong>.</p>

<p>While removing a large mandibular torus, the mucoperiosteal elevator
accidentally slips towards the floor of the mouth. Which of the
following structures is most likely to be injured? A. Lingual artery B.
Lingual nerve <strong>C. Sublingual gland</strong> D. Mylohyoid
muscle</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question is about the anatomy of
the floor of the mouth in the premolar region, where tori are common. *
<strong>Anatomical Relationships:</strong> The structure that lies most
immediately adjacent to the lingual aspect of the mandible in the
premolar area is the <strong>sublingual gland</strong>. It sits in the
sublingual fossa, directly deep to the mucosa of the floor of the mouth.
* <strong>Lingual Nerve Path:</strong> The lingual nerve runs more
posteriorly. It is in close contact with the mandible in the third molar
region, but as it travels anteriorly, it moves medially (inward), away
from the mandible and towards the tongue, passing superior to the
submandibular duct. * <strong>Conclusion:</strong> An instrument
slipping directly off the bone in the premolar torus region would most
likely perforate the thin mucosa and enter the sublingual gland.</p>

<p>A 6-year-old child has a primary first molar with a pulpotomy. During
a recall, a bitewing shows an interproximal radiolucency on the distal
aspect of the tooth. What is the most appropriate management? A. Observe
and monitor. B. Endodontic retreatment of the primary molar. C. Restore
with a Class II composite restoration. <strong>D. Extraction of the
primary first molar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A pulpotomy is considered to have
failed if there are signs of subsequent pathology. * <strong>The
Finding:</strong> The development of a new carious lesion on a tooth
that has already had a pulpotomy indicates a high likelihood of
bacterial leakage and failure of the pulpotomy medicament. *
<strong>Prognosis of Retreatment:</strong> Re-treating a primary molar
pulpotomy or attempting a pulpectomy on a previously treated tooth has a
very poor prognosis. The tooth is considered non-restorable from a
pulpal health perspective. * <strong>Management:</strong> The standard
of care for a failed pulpotomy in a primary molar is
<strong>extraction</strong>, followed by placement of a space maintainer
if necessary (in this case, a band and loop would be needed to hold the
space for the erupting first premolar).</p>

<p>A 7-year-old patient weighing 20kg received three cartridges of 4%
prilocaine. Shortly after, the patient appeared drowsy and disoriented.
What is the most likely diagnosis? A. Allergic reaction B.
Methemoglobinemia <strong>C. Local anesthetic overdose</strong> D.
Syncope</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The signs
(drowsiness, disorientation) following the administration of a large
amount of local anesthetic are classic central nervous system (CNS)
symptoms of an <strong>overdose</strong>. * <strong>Toxicity
Progression:</strong> LA toxicity typically manifests first with CNS
excitation (restlessness, tremors), followed by CNS depression
(drowsiness, disorientation, loss of consciousness). In children, the
excitatory phase can be very brief or absent, and they may proceed
directly to CNS depression. * <strong>Calculation Check:</strong> *
Maximum dose for prilocaine is ~6 mg/kg. * Patient weight = 20 kg. Max
dose = 20 kg * 6 mg/kg = 120 mg. * Dose administered: 3 cartridges * 1.8
mL/cartridge * 40 mg/mL = 216 mg. * The patient received almost double
the maximum recommended dose, confirming an overdose. *
<strong>Methemoglobinemia (B):</strong> This is a specific risk with
high doses of prilocaine, but its primary sign is cyanosis (bluish skin)
that doesn’t respond to oxygen. While possible, the CNS signs point more
directly to a general overdose.</p>

<h3 id="question-78">Question 78:</h3>
<p>The removal of which of the following impactions is associated with
an increased risk of injury to the inferior alveolar nerve? A.
Mesioangular B. Distoangular <strong>C. Horizontal</strong> D.
Vertical</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The risk of nerve injury is related to
the proximity of the tooth roots to the nerve canal and the amount of
bone removal required for extraction. * <strong>Horizontal
Impaction:</strong> In a horizontal impaction, the crown of the third
molar is often directly over the nerve canal, and the roots are
frequently superimposed on or in direct contact with the nerve. *
<strong>Surgical Difficulty:</strong> To remove a horizontal impaction,
the surgeon must remove a significant amount of buccal and distal bone,
often deep into the mandible, to expose the tooth for sectioning. This
deep drilling and sectioning places the bur in very close proximity to
the inferior alveolar nerve, creating the highest risk of direct trauma.
* While a distoangular impaction can be the most difficult to elevate,
the horizontal impaction carries the highest risk of iatrogenic nerve
injury during bone removal and tooth sectioning.</p>

involved space.</strong> C. Infection spreads from the maxillary teeth
via the buccal space. D. The most common cause is pericoronitis around a
mandibular premolar.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The masticatory space is a group of
fascial spaces associated with the muscles of mastication (masseter,
temporalis, medial and lateral pterygoids). * <strong>Most Common
Source:</strong> The most frequent source of infection is a periapical
abscess of a <strong>mandibular third molar</strong>. * <strong>Most
Commonly Involved Space (B):</strong> Infections from mandibular third
molars tend to spread into the contiguous spaces. The
<strong>submasseteric space</strong>, which lies between the masseter
muscle and the lateral aspect of the ramus, is the most commonly
involved component of the masticatory space. * <strong>Why others are
false:</strong> * (A, D) The source is mandibular molars (especially
third molars), not premolars. * (C) Maxillary teeth infections spread to

<strong>healthy</strong> (no inflammation, no bleeding) but has a
history of periodontitis, which is evident by the <strong>generalized
recession</strong> (a sign of past attachment loss). * <strong>The
Diagnosis:</strong> * The periodontium is <strong>“reduced”</strong>
because it has lost bone and attachment due to the previous disease. It
is not “intact.” * The current state is <strong>“clinical gingival

compensating curves. <strong>B. It balances chewing efficiency with
reduced lateral dislodging forces.</strong> C. It enhances aesthetics
through symmetrical anterior guidance. D. It improves speech clarity via
posterior teeth alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Lingualized occlusion is a specific
occlusal scheme designed to improve the stability of complete dentures.
* <strong>The Concept:</strong> It uses a sharp maxillary lingual cusp
occluding into a wide, shallow central fossa of a non-anatomic or
semi-anatomic mandibular tooth. The maxillary buccal cusps are taken out
of occlusion. * <strong>The Advantages (B):</strong> * <strong>Chewing
Efficiency:</strong> It maintains good chewing efficiency because a
sharp cusp is still used for cutting food. * <strong>Reduced Lateral
Forces:</strong> By eliminating contacts on the buccal cusps, the
potentially destabilizing lateral forces that occur during chewing are
significantly reduced. The forces are focused vertically through the
central fossa, which enhances denture stability. * Compensating curves
(A) are still necessary to achieve protrusive balance. It has little to
do with aesthetics (C) or speech (D).</p>

implant removal. B. Flap surgery with laser therapy. <strong>C.
Non-surgical mechanical debridement and oral hygiene
instruction.</strong> D. Systemic antibiotics and occlusal adjustment

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The signs
(bleeding, deep pockets, radiographic bone loss) are diagnostic of

The first step in managing peri-implantitis is always a
<strong>non-surgical approach</strong>. This is analogous to Phase I
therapy for periodontitis. * <strong>The Procedure (C):</strong> The
goal is to remove the bacterial biofilm from the implant surface. This

<strong>Mandibular Body:</strong> The body of the mandible (the
horizontal portion) develops via <strong>intramembranous
ossification</strong>. Bone forms directly from a condensation of
mesenchymal tissue that appears lateral to Meckel’s cartilage. *
<strong>Meckel’s Cartilage (C):</strong> This acts as a scaffold for the
developing mandible but, with minor exceptions, does
<strong>not</strong> turn into the bone of the mandibular body itself;
it largely degenerates. * <strong>Endochondral Ossification (B,
D):</strong> The condyle, coronoid process, and symphysis develop later
from secondary cartilages, which do undergo endochondral ossification to
contribute to the growth of the ramus and chin. However, the initial
formation of the body is intramembranous.</p>

<h3 id="question-89">Question 89:</h3>
<p>A patient with congestive heart failure is prescribed metoprolol.
Which statement best describes its therapeutic effect? A. It is a
non-selective beta-blocker that decreases afterload. <strong>B. It is a
selective beta-1 receptor blocker that normalizes the heart’s response
to sympathetic stimulation.</strong> C. It increases actin-myosin
cross-linking, which increases cardiac contractility. D. It directly
stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The use of beta-blockers in heart
failure seems counterintuitive but is based on a specific physiological
principle. * <strong>Pathophysiology of CHF:</strong> In chronic heart
failure, the sympathetic nervous system is constantly over-activated to
compensate for poor cardiac output. This chronic overstimulation of
beta-1 receptors in the heart causes them to become
<strong>downregulated</strong> (less responsive). * <strong>Therapeutic
Effect of Metoprolol (B):</strong> Metoprolol is a <strong>selective
beta-1 blocker</strong>. By blocking the receptors from the constant
sympathetic barrage, it allows them to rest and
<strong>upregulate</strong> or “re-sensitize” over time. This restores
or <strong>normalizes the heart’s response to sympathetic
stimulation</strong>, making it more efficient in the long term and
improving overall cardiac function and survival. It does not directly
increase contractility (C); its long-term effect is to improve the
efficiency of the existing system.</p>

<p>A 45-year-old patient has a well-defined radiolucent lesion in the
posterior mandible. A biopsy shows numerous multinucleated giant cells
in a fibrous stroma. What is the most likely diagnosis? A. Paget’s
disease of bone B. Fibrous dysplasia <strong>C. Central giant cell
granuloma (CGCG)</strong> D. Ossifying fibroma</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The histological description is the key
to the diagnosis. * <strong>Central Giant Cell Granuloma
(CGCG):</strong> The pathognomonic histological feature of a CGCG is the
presence of <strong>numerous multinucleated giant cells</strong>
scattered throughout a vascular, fibrous connective tissue stroma.
Radiographically, it appears as a well-defined unilocular or
multilocular radiolucency. * <strong>Other Options:</strong> *
<strong>Paget’s Disease:</strong> Histology shows a “mosaic pattern” of
woven bone; radiographically, it has a “cotton wool” appearance in its
later stages. * <strong>Fibrous Dysplasia:</strong> Histology shows
irregular trabeculae of woven bone in a fibrous stroma, often described
as “Chinese characters”; radiographically, it has a “ground-glass”
appearance. * <strong>Ossifying Fibroma:</strong> Is a fibro-osseous
lesion containing bone and cementum-like tissue, not primarily giant
cells.</p>

<p>Which antiviral medication acts by inhibiting neuraminidase, thereby
preventing the release of newly formed viral particles from infected
cells? A. Acyclovir <strong>B. Oseltamivir</strong> C. Ganciclovir D.
Amantadine</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question tests the mechanism of
action of different antivirals. * <strong>Oseltamivir
(Tamiflu):</strong> This is the classic example of a
<strong>neuraminidase inhibitor</strong>. Influenza viruses use the
neuraminidase enzyme to cleave themselves from the host cell membrane
after they have replicated. By inhibiting this enzyme, Oseltamivir
“traps” the new virions on the surface of the infected cell, preventing
their release and spread to other cells. * <strong>Other MOAs:</strong>
* <strong>Acyclovir/Ganciclovir:</strong> Are nucleoside analogues that
inhibit viral DNA polymerase, causing chain termination. *
<strong>Amantadine:</strong> Blocks the M2 protein ion channel,
interfering with viral uncoating.</p>

<h3 id="question-92">Question 92:</h3>
<p>A patient has an unerupted maxillary permanent canine. The adjacent
lateral incisor is retroclined and distally tilted. This most likely
indicates: A. Buccal impaction of the canine <strong>B. Palatal
impaction of the canine</strong> C. Transposition of the canine and
lateral incisor D. Agenesis of the canine</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The position of the lateral incisor is
a key diagnostic clue for the location of an impacted canine. *
<strong>Palatal Impaction (B):</strong> When a canine is impacted
palatally, its eruption path is from the palatal and distal aspect. As
it moves, it often contacts the <strong>root</strong> of the lateral
incisor. This pressure on the root causes the crown of the lateral
incisor to be tipped <strong>distally</strong> and flared
<strong>buccally (proclined)</strong>. <em>[NOTE: The transcript
incorrectly states retroclined, but the classic sign for palatal
impaction is proclination/flaring of the lateral incisor. The distal
tilt is correct.]</em> * <strong>Buccal Impaction (A):</strong> When a
canine is impacted buccally, it is more likely to cause the lateral
incisor root to move palatally, which can result in the crown tipping
mesially or becoming retroclined.</p>
<p>Given the options and the common clinical signs, the distal tilt is
the strongest indicator pointing toward a palatal impaction.</p>

<h3 id="question-93">Question 93:</h3>
<p>For the surgical extraction of a badly decayed premolar, the dentist
elevates a flap and removes buccal bone. What is the adequate amount of
bone removal required? A. Half the mesiodistal width and one-third the
length of the root. <strong>B. Full mesiodistal width of the root and
two-thirds the length of the root.</strong> C. Half the mesiodistal
width and the full length of the root. D. Full mesiodistal width and
one-third the length of the root.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The goal of bone removal is to expose
enough of the root to create a purchase point for an elevator and an
unimpeded path for removal. * <strong>Vertical Dimension:</strong> Bone
should be removed from the crest down approximately <strong>one-half to
two-thirds</strong> the length of the root. This exposes enough root
surface to apply an elevator effectively without having to go to the
apex. * <strong>Horizontal Dimension:</strong> The bone removal should
extend to the <strong>full mesiodistal width</strong> of the root. This
creates a wide enough “trough” to allow the tooth to be luxated and
removed buccally without being locked in by the mesial and distal
bone.</p>

<h3 id="question-94">Question 94:</h3>
<p>A dentist aims to reduce distortion in a periapical radiograph by
adjusting the geometry of the paralleling technique. Which of the
following contributes most effectively to minimizing distortion? A.
Decreasing the source-to-object distance. B. Decreasing the
object-to-receptor distance. <strong>C. Orienting the central ray
perpendicular to both the tooth and the receptor.</strong> D. Placing
the receptor close to the tooth regardless of the beam angle.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Radiographic distortion (elongation or
foreshortening) is caused by incorrect alignment between the x-ray beam,
the object (tooth), and the receptor. * <strong>Rule of Perpendicularity
(C):</strong> To prevent distortion, the <strong>central ray of the
x-ray beam must be directed perpendicular to both the long axis of the
tooth and the plane of the receptor</strong>. The paralleling technique
is designed to achieve this by placing the receptor parallel to the
tooth and then directing the beam at a right angle to both. *
<strong>Magnification vs. Distortion:</strong> * Options A and B relate
to <strong>magnification and sharpness</strong>, not distortion.
Decreasing the object-receptor distance (B) reduces magnification.
Increasing the source-object distance also reduces magnification. *
Distortion is purely an issue of angular relationships. Option D
describes the bisecting angle technique, which inherently introduces
distortion because the beam is not perpendicular to the tooth and
receptor.</p>

<h3 id="question-95">Question 95:</h3>
<p>Which of the following best explains why the rest is placed on the
mesial surface of the terminal abutment in an RPI clasp assembly? A. To
convert a Class II lever into a Class I lever. <strong>B. To allow the
retentive I-bar to disengage under functional loading.</strong> C. To
prevent food impaction between the abutment and the prosthesis. D. To
reduce the impact of vertical occlusal forces on the abutment tooth.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The RPI (Rest, Plate, I-bar) system is
a stress-releasing clasp design for distal extension RPDs. * <strong>The
Mechanism:</strong> The rest is placed on the <strong>mesial</strong>
fossa. The fulcrum line runs through this mesial rest. During function,
when occlusal force is applied to the denture base, the denture rotates
slightly into the tissue. * <strong>The Disengagement (B):</strong>
Because the fulcrum is on the mesial, this rotation causes the retentive
I-bar tip (located on the buccal surface, gingival to the height of
contour) to move <strong>downward and forward, into a deeper
undercut</strong>. This movement causes the clasp to
<strong>disengage</strong> from the tooth surface, releasing any
potentially harmful torquing forces on the abutment tooth. * This design
converts a harmful Class I lever (which would occur with a distal rest)
into a more favorable Class II lever. The primary reason for the mesial
rest is to facilitate this stress-releasing movement.</p>

<p>Which of the following statements describing lithium’s properties is
incorrect? A. It is a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder. B.
It prevents the formation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) within the CNS.
<strong>C. NSAIDs increase lithium excretion and decrease the
effectiveness of lithium.</strong> D. Sodium restriction can result in
lithium toxicity.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question is about the pharmacology
and drug interactions of lithium. * <strong>Incorrect Statement
(C):</strong> This statement is the opposite of what actually happens.
NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) can interfere with renal function and
<strong>decrease the renal excretion of lithium</strong>. This leads to
an <strong>increase</strong> in lithium plasma levels, which can easily
cause <strong>lithium toxicity</strong>. Lithium has a very narrow
therapeutic index, making this a clinically significant interaction. *
<strong>Why others are correct:</strong> * (A) This is its primary
clinical use. * (B) This is its proposed mechanism of action. * (D) The
kidneys handle sodium and lithium in a similar way. If a patient is
sodium-depleted (e.g., due to diuretics or a low-salt diet), the kidneys
will try to conserve sodium and will inadvertently conserve lithium as
well, leading to increased levels and potential toxicity.</p>

<p>A 45-year-old patient presents for a routine exam. You observe
bilateral white, reticular (lace-like) lesions on the buccal mucosa. The
patient reports no pain. What is the most appropriate management?
<strong>A. No treatment is required; observation is sufficient.</strong>
B. Biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. C. Prescription of topical
corticosteroids. D. Prescription of systemic corticosteroids.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
clinical description (bilateral, white, reticular/lacy lesions on the
buccal mucosa) is pathognomonic for the <strong>reticular form of oral
lichen planus</strong>. * <strong>Management:</strong> * When the
diagnosis is clinically obvious and the patient is
<strong>asymptomatic</strong>, no treatment is required. The patient
should be reassured and the lesions simply monitored at regular recall
appointments. * <strong>Biopsy (B):</strong> Is only indicated if the
diagnosis is uncertain or if the lesion has an unusual appearance (e.g.,
ulcerative, non-healing) to rule out dysplasia or malignancy. *
<strong>Corticosteroids (C, D):</strong> Are only prescribed for the
<strong>symptomatic</strong> forms of lichen planus (e.g., erosive or
atrophic) to manage pain and inflammation.</p>

support? <strong>A. 2</strong> B. 4 C. 6 D. 8</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> There are established guidelines for
the number of implants needed to support an overdenture. *
<strong>Mandibular Overdenture:</strong> The minimum standard of care
for a mandibular overdenture is <strong>two implants</strong>, typically
placed in the canine or premolar regions. These two implants provide

<p>During a cleaning appointment, a 24-year-old pregnant patient in her
third trimester complains of feeling dizzy and then loses consciousness.
What is the most likely diagnosis? A. Hypoglycemia B. Vasovagal syncope
<strong>C. Supine hypotensive syndrome</strong> D. Partial seizure</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>The Scenario:</strong> A
patient in late-stage pregnancy becomes syncopal while lying flat in the
dental chair. * <strong>Supine Hypotensive Syndrome:</strong> This is
the most likely cause. In the third trimester, the heavy, gravid uterus
can compress the <strong>inferior vena cava</strong> when the patient is
in the supine (lying flat on her back) position. This compression
drastically reduces venous return to the heart, leading to a sudden drop
in cardiac output and blood pressure, causing dizziness and syncope. *
<strong>Management:</strong> The treatment is to immediately roll the
patient onto her <strong>left side</strong>. This displaces the uterus
off the inferior vena cava, restoring blood flow to the heart.</p>

Question 156: What is the most appropriate flap design for the
management of a periodontitis case associated with shallow interdental
osseous craters in the right mandibular posterior sextant? A.
Split-thickness flap, undisplaced B. Full-thickness flap, undisplaced C.
Split-thickness flap, apically displaced <strong>D. Full-thickness flap,
apically displaced</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The treatment for shallow osseous
craters is <strong>ostectomy and osteoplasty</strong> (bone
recontouring), not guided tissue regeneration. The flap design must
facilitate this procedure. 1. <strong>Full-thickness
vs. Split-thickness:</strong> Since the procedure involves direct
manipulation and removal of bone, a <strong>full-thickness flap</strong>
(including the periosteum) must be raised to fully expose the alveolar
bone. 2. <strong>Apically displaced vs. Undisplaced:</strong> After
removing bone to create a more positive architecture, the soft tissue
flap must be repositioned to match the new, more apical bone level.
Therefore, the flap must be <strong>apically displaced</strong>. If it
were left undisplaced, a deep pocket would re-form between the flap and
the recontoured bone. The rule is: “soft tissue follows the bone.”</p>

<p>Which of the following drug properties is associated with high oral
bioavailability? A. Drugs with high first-pass metabolism B. Highly
hydrophilic drugs <strong>C. Highly lipophilic yet soluble in aqueous
solutions</strong> D. Drugs that are extensively bound to plasma
proteins</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Oral bioavailability is the fraction of
an orally administered drug that reaches systemic circulation. For high
bioavailability, a drug must be both dissolved and absorbed. *
<strong>Correct Answer (C):</strong> A drug that is <strong>soluble in
aqueous solutions</strong> can dissolve in the gastric fluids. A drug
that is <strong>highly lipophilic</strong> can then easily pass through
the lipid membranes of the intestinal cells to be absorbed into the
bloodstream. This combination is ideal for high oral bioavailability. *
<strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> * (A) High first-pass metabolism
means the drug is heavily metabolized by the liver after absorption, so
very little reaches systemic circulation. This results in low
bioavailability. * (B) Highly hydrophilic (water-loving) drugs cannot
easily cross the lipid cell membranes of the gut and are poorly
absorbed. * (D) Plasma protein binding affects a drug’s
<em>distribution</em> after it’s already in the blood; it does not
affect its initial bioavailability.</p>

(A) <strong>Afferent</strong> neurons are sensory; they carry signals
<em>to</em> the CNS. <strong>Efferent</strong> neurons carry signals
<em>from</em> the CNS. * (B) The neurotransmitter at the parasympathetic

<p>Which of the following medications may increase the risk of digitalis
(digoxin) toxicity? <strong>A. Chlorothiazide</strong> B. Spironolactone
C. Diazepam D. Amiloride</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Digoxin toxicity is famously
potentiated by <strong>hypokalemia</strong> (low potassium). *
<strong>Mechanism:</strong> Digoxin and potassium compete for the same
binding site on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in cardiac cells. If potassium
levels are low, there is less competition for digoxin, allowing more of
it to bind to the pump. This leads to an exaggerated effect and
potential toxicity. * <strong>Diuretics and Potassium:</strong> *
<strong>Chlorothiazide</strong> (a thiazide diuretic) and loop diuretics
cause significant potassium loss in the urine, leading to hypokalemia. *
<strong>Spironolactone</strong> and <strong>Amiloride</strong> are
<strong>potassium-sparing diuretics</strong>; they do not cause
hypokalemia and are therefore safer to use with digoxin. *
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> By causing hypokalemia, chlorothiazide
increases the risk of digoxin toxicity.</p>

<p>A patient is prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg for pain management
following an extraction. Which instruction should be included? A. Take
one tablet orally q6h for 3 days. B. Take one tablet orally q6h for 4
days. C. Take one tablet orally q6h for 5 days. <strong>D. Take one
tablet orally q6h PRN pain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key principle in prescribing
analgesics (painkillers) is that they should be taken only when needed.
* <strong>PRN (pro re nata):</strong> This Latin term means “as the
thing is needed” or simply “as needed.” * <strong>Rationale:</strong>
Analgesics are prescribed to manage pain. If the patient is not
experiencing pain, they should not take the medication. Prescribing it
for a fixed number of days (e.g., “for 5 days”) implies the patient must
take it for the full duration, regardless of their symptoms. This is
inappropriate and leads to unnecessary medication use. *
<strong>Contrast with Antibiotics:</strong> Antibiotics must be taken
for the full prescribed course to ensure the infection is completely
eradicated, even if the patient feels better. Analgesics are purely for
symptom control. * <strong>Special Cases:</strong> For drugs like
Ketorolac, you would still write “PRN pain” but add a limitation like
“Do not use for more than 5 days.”</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The absolute prerequisite for
proceeding to surgical periodontal therapy is <strong>excellent patient
oral hygiene</strong>. * <strong>Correct Answer (E):</strong> This
patient meets all the criteria for surgery. They have undergone initial
therapy (SRP), have demonstrated <strong>good oral hygiene</strong>, but
still have <strong>unresolved deep pockets</strong>. This indicates that
non-surgical therapy was insufficient to resolve the disease, and
surgical access is now required. * <strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> *
(A) This patient cannot have surgery because of their <strong>poor oral
hygiene</strong>. They must undergo re-instruction and repeat
non-surgical therapy first. * (B) This patient is periodontally healthy
on a reduced periodontium. There is no active disease, so no surgery is
needed. * (C) The primary problem is a local factor (overhang). The

<h3 id="question-162">Question 162:</h3>
<p>Which of the following best explains the role of guiding planes in
the retention of a removable partial denture (RPD)? A. Guiding planes
have no contribution to the retention. <strong>B. Guiding planes enhance
retention by limiting the path of removal.</strong> C. Guiding planes
increase retention by providing mechanical undercuts. D. Guiding planes
ensure intimate contact with soft tissues.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Guiding planes are parallel surfaces
prepared on abutment teeth that are contacted by the corresponding rigid
guiding plates of the RPD framework. * <strong>Primary
Function:</strong> Their main role is to define a single, specific
<strong>path of insertion and removal</strong>. * <strong>Contribution
to Retention (B):</strong> By creating only one path of removal, the
guiding planes prevent the denture from being dislodged by forces coming
from other directions (e.g., sticky foods pulling at an angle). The
frictional contact between the parallel surfaces of the guiding planes
and plates provides resistance to dislodgement along this single path,
thus enhancing overall retention. This is often compared to the
difficulty of opening a well-fitting box by lifting it straight up. *
<strong>Incorrect Option C:</strong> Guiding planes do not engage
undercuts. That is the sole function of the flexible retentive clasp
arm.</p>

<p>A patient needs restorations on teeth #46 (molar) and #34 (premolar).
Which are the most appropriate anesthetic techniques to use in the same
visit? A. Bilateral inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) B. Bilateral
incisive nerve block C. Right IANB and left mental nerve block
<strong>D. Right IANB and left incisive nerve block</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The goal is to achieve pulpal
anesthesia for all teeth while minimizing patient discomfort. *
<strong>Right Side (#46):</strong> A mandibular molar requires an
<strong>IANB</strong>. There is no other reliable way to achieve pulpal
anesthesia. * <strong>Left Side (#34):</strong> A mandibular premolar
can be anesthetized pulapally by either an IANB or an <strong>incisive
nerve block</strong>. * <strong>Comparing Options:</strong> *
<strong>Bilateral IANB (A):</strong> While effective, this is highly
uncomfortable for the patient, leaving their entire tongue, chin, and
both sides of their lower lip numb. It is generally avoided if possible.
* <strong>Mental Nerve Block (C):</strong> This only provides soft
tissue anesthesia. It does <strong>not</strong> anesthetize the pulp of
the tooth. * <strong>Right IANB and Left Incisive Nerve Block
(D):</strong> This is the best option. It provides the necessary
anesthesia for the molar on the right side. On the left, it uses a more
localized block (incisive) to anesthetize the premolar pulp without
numbing the entire half of the mandible and tongue, making it much more
comfortable for the patient.</p>

management? <strong>A. Preventive resin restoration (PRR)</strong> B.
Class I composite restoration C. Pit and fissure sealants D. Class I
resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) restoration</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question requires precise
understanding of restorative terminology. * <strong>The
Situation:</strong> There is a distinct carious lesion in one part of
the occlusal surface (mesial pit), while the rest of the fissure system
is sound but at high risk (deep and stained). * <strong>Preventive Resin
Restoration (PRR):</strong> This is the specific term for the
conservative management of this exact scenario. It involves: 1.
Performing a very small, minimally invasive composite restoration only
in the area of the carious lesion (the mesial pit). 2. Placing a fissure
sealant over the remaining non-carious, at-risk pits and fissures. *
This approach is both therapeutic (treating the existing decay) and
preventive (protecting the rest of the tooth), and is more conservative
than preparing the entire occlusal surface for a full Class I
restoration.</p>

<p>A 40-year-old patient with a history of HIV presents with severe gum
pain. Examination reveals ulcerated marginal gingiva, generalized
recession, and 1-2mm probing depths. What is the diagnosis? A.
Necrotizing gingivitis <strong>B. Necrotizing periodontitis
(NP)</strong> C. Necrotizing stomatitis D. Periodontitis</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key is to integrate the signs of
necrosis with the evidence of attachment loss. * <strong>Necrotizing
Features:</strong> Severe pain and ulcerated marginal gingiva are
hallmark signs of a necrotizing periodontal disease. *
<strong>Attachment Loss:</strong> The presence of <strong>generalized
recession and radiographic bone loss</strong> indicates that attachment
loss has occurred. * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> * Because there is
attachment loss, it cannot be necrotizing <em>gingivitis</em> (which is
confined to the gingiva). * Therefore, the diagnosis is
<strong>necrotizing periodontitis</strong>. * <strong>An Important
Feature of NP:</strong> NP is characterized by rapid and severe
destruction of the gingival margin. This means that even though there is
significant attachment loss (seen as recession), deep pockets do not
form because the soft tissue wall of the potential pocket is destroyed.
This explains the paradoxical finding of severe attachment loss with
shallow probing depths.</p>

<p>While explaining a procedure, your patient’s breathing becomes rapid
and shallow, and they experience tingling in their fingers. What is the
immediate management? A. Place the patient in a supine position.
<strong>B. Instruct the patient to breathe into cupped hands.</strong>
C. Administer oxygen. D. Call 911.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
signs—rapid, shallow breathing (tachypnea) and tingling in the
extremities (paresthesia)—are classic symptoms of
<strong>hyperventilation</strong>. This is often triggered by anxiety. *
<strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> During hyperventilation, the patient
rapidly “blows off” too much carbon dioxide, leading to respiratory
alkalosis and a drop in blood CO2 levels (hypocapnia). *
<strong>Management (B):</strong> The goal is to restore the normal CO2
level. Having the patient breathe into their own <strong>cupped
hands</strong> (or a paper bag) forces them to re-breathe their exhaled
CO2, which corrects the hypocapnia and resolves the symptoms. *
<strong>Oxygen (C) is contraindicated</strong> as it would do nothing to

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The question is asking to measure
<strong>incidence</strong>—the rate of <em>new</em> cases of a disease
over a period of time. * <strong>Cohort Study:</strong> This is the
ideal design for measuring incidence. A group (cohort) of disease-free

for five years, you can directly calculate the incidence of new herpes
infections. * <strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> *
<strong>Cross-sectional study</strong> measures
<strong>prevalence</strong> (the number of existing cases at a single

<h3 id="question-168">Question 168:</h3>
<p>A pregnant patient presents with a red, fleshy, easily-bleeding
nodule on her maxillary gingiva. What is the most appropriate
periodontal diagnosis? A. Gingivitis associated with dental biofilm
alone B. Gingivitis mediated by systemic or local factors <strong>C.
Non-dental biofilm-induced gingival disease (Reactive Process)</strong>
D. Necrotizing gingivitis</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question tests the 2017
classification system. * <strong>The Lesion:</strong> The description is
a classic <strong>pyogenic granuloma</strong> (also known as a pregnancy
tumor). * <strong>The Classification:</strong> A pyogenic granuloma is
not a form of gingivitis (which is diffuse inflammation of the gingiva).
It is a <strong>reactive process</strong>—an exuberant tissue response
to a local irritant (like plaque or calculus), which is hormonally
exaggerated during pregnancy. * <strong>The Category (C):</strong> Under
the 2017 classification, reactive processes like pyogenic granuloma,
fibroma, and peripheral giant cell granuloma are categorized as
<strong>Non-dental biofilm-induced gingival diseases</strong>. *
<strong>Important Distinction:</strong> If the pregnant patient had
generalized bleeding on probing and inflammation <em>without</em> a
distinct nodule, the diagnosis would be “Gingivitis mediated by systemic
factors (pregnancy).” The question is describing the nodule itself, not
generalized gingivitis.</p>

<h3 id="question-169">Question 169:</h3>
<p>Which of the following occlusal schemes is most likely to result in
occlusal wear or attrition? A. Group function B. Canine guidance
<strong>C. Bilateral balanced occlusion</strong> D. Mutually protected
occlusion</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Attrition is wear caused by
tooth-to-tooth contact. The occlusal scheme with the most contact during
function will cause the most wear. * <strong>Bilateral Balanced
Occlusion:</strong> This scheme, primarily used for complete dentures,
is designed to have <strong>maximum tooth contact in all excursive
movements</strong>. During lateral and protrusive movements, teeth on
both the working and non-working sides remain in contact to stabilize
the dentures. This constant, widespread contact leads to the highest
potential for attrition. * <strong>Canine Guidance / Mutually Protected
Occlusion:</strong> In these schemes, all posterior teeth
<strong>disocclude</strong> (separate) during excursions, guided by the
canines or incisors. This minimizes posterior tooth contact and thus
minimizes attrition. * <strong>Group Function:</strong> More teeth are
in contact than in canine guidance, but there is still no contact on the
non-working side, making it less attritive than a fully balanced
scheme.</p>

<p>A patient with facial trauma exhibits difficulty in occlusion and
limited mandibular movement. Which finding is most suggestive of a
bilateral subcondylar fracture? <strong>A. Anterior open bite</strong>
B. Posterior open bite C. Glossoptosis (tongue falling back) D.
Paresthesia of the lower lip</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A bilateral subcondylar fracture
decouples the mandible from its normal hinge points at the base of the
skull. * <strong>The Mechanism:</strong> With both condylar necks
fractured, the strong pull of the elevator muscles of mastication
(masseter, medial pterygoid, temporalis) causes the posterior portion of
the mandible (the rami) to be displaced <strong>superiorly
(upward)</strong>. This causes a shortening of the posterior ramus
height. * <strong>The Result (A):</strong> As the posterior rami are
pulled up, the mandible pivots downward at the front, like a seesaw.
This results in the posterior teeth contacting prematurely, while the
anterior teeth are left in an <strong>anterior open bite</strong>. *
<strong>Posterior open bite (B)</strong> is more characteristic of an
intracapsular condylar fracture where bleeding into the joint space
pushes the ramus downward.</p>

<p>A master cone fits to the full working length on a radiograph. After
obturation, the final radiograph shows the fill is 2mm short. What is
the most likely reason? A. Inaccurate working length determination B.
The master cone is too small C. The master cone is too large <strong>D.
Bending of the tip of the master cone during obturation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a clinical problem-solving
question. We must find the error that occurred <em>between</em> the
cone-fit and the final obturation. * <strong>Eliminating Other
Options:</strong> * (A) Inaccurate working length is incorrect because
the cone <em>did</em> fit to the correct length initially. * (B) A cone
that is too small would have gone past the apex. * (C) A cone that is
too large would not have reached the apex in the first place. *
<strong>The Correct Reason (D):</strong> The master cone was confirmed
to be the correct size and at the correct length. The only logical
explanation for it being short in the final fill is an error during the
obturation procedure itself. The most common error is accidentally
<strong>bending or crimping the delicate apical tip of the gutta-percha
cone</strong> against the wall of the access cavity as it is being
placed. This tiny bend prevents the cone from seating to its full
original depth.</p>

<h3 id="question-172">Question 172:</h3>
<p>Which of the following conditions will increase the risk of
ecchymosis (bruising)? <strong>A. Chronic alcoholism</strong> B.
Diabetes mellitus C. Sjogren’s syndrome D. Vitamin D deficiency</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ecchymosis is subcutaneous bleeding. It
is a sign of a defect in hemostasis, either with platelets or clotting
factors. * <strong>Chronic Alcoholism:</strong> Chronic heavy alcohol
use causes significant <strong>liver damage (cirrhosis)</strong>. The
liver is responsible for synthesizing most of the body’s clotting
factors (e.g., fibrinogen, prothrombin). When the liver is damaged, it
cannot produce these factors, leading to a coagulopathy and an increased
tendency to bleed and bruise. * <strong>Other Options:</strong>
Diabetes, Sjogren’s, and Vitamin D deficiency are not primarily
associated with bleeding disorders. Diabetes is associated with delayed
healing.</p>

<p>An HIV-positive patient is scheduled for a full mouth radiographic
series. The clinician decides to double glove. Which ethical principle
is being violated? A. Beneficence B. Nonmaleficence <strong>C.
Justice</strong> D. Autonomy</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question is about treating all
patients with the same standard of care. * <strong>Standard/Universal
Precautions:</strong> These protocols are designed to be used for
<strong>every single patient</strong>, assuming that any patient could
have an infectious disease. The standard of care does not require double
gloving for routine procedures like taking radiographs. *
<strong>Justice:</strong> This ethical principle dictates that patients
in similar circumstances should be treated fairly and equally. By
singling out the HIV-positive patient for an extra, unnecessary
precaution (double gloving for a non-surgical procedure), the clinician
is treating them differently based on their medical status. This is a
form of discrimination and a clear violation of the principle of
justice.</p>

<h3 id="question-174">Question 174:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is the most important consideration in
carrying out a reline of a maxillary and mandibular complete denture? A.
Maintaining undercuts in the denture to retain the impression material.
B. Avoiding removing any acrylic on the fitting surface of the dentures.
C. Removing acrylic from the post-dam area prior to taking the
impression. <strong>D. Taking the impression for both dentures
simultaneously while the patient is occluded in centric
relation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The goal of a reline is to improve the
fit of the denture base without altering the established occlusion or
vertical dimension. * <strong>The Problem:</strong> Taking separate
impressions for the upper and lower dentures can easily introduce errors
and change the occlusal relationship between them. * <strong>The
Solution (D):</strong> The most accurate method is a
<strong>closed-mouth impression technique</strong>. The impression
material is placed in both dentures, which are then inserted. The
patient is guided to close into their established <strong>centric
relation/maximum intercuspation</strong>, and they hold this position
while the material sets. This technique functionally relates the upper
and lower dentures, ensuring that the existing correct occlusion is
preserved in the new relined state. * <strong>Other options are
incorrect steps:</strong> Undercuts must be removed (A), a thin layer of
acrylic must be removed to create space (B), and the post-dam area
should not be altered (C).</p>

<h3 id="question-175">Question 175:</h3>
<p>When 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is used to achieve hemostasis
in a direct pulp cap, which of the following takes place? A. Loss of
pulp vitality <strong>B. A superficial area of sterile necrosis</strong>
C. Tertiary dentin formation D. Differentiation of odontoblasts</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> NaOCl is an effective hemostatic agent
but is also cytotoxic. * <strong>The Effect (B):</strong> When applied
to the exposed pulp, the low-concentration NaOCl causes a very shallow,
controlled chemical “burn” on the surface layer of the pulp tissue. This
creates a <strong>superficial area of necrosis</strong>. Because NaOCl
is also a powerful disinfectant, this necrotic zone is
<strong>sterile</strong>. * <strong>The Outcome:</strong> The underlying
healthy pulp tissue is then able to heal and repair itself beneath this
sterile necrotic layer. The pulp remains vital. The use of a liner like
MTA or calcium hydroxide over this area is what then stimulates the
differentiation of odontoblasts (D) and subsequent tertiary dentin
formation (C). The NaOCl itself only creates the sterile necrotic
zone.</p>

<p>Which of the following best describes a dentist’s obligation to treat
patients? A. Dentists must treat every person who requests care. B.
Dentists may deny treatment for any reason. C. Dentists must treat only
those with insurance coverage. <strong>D. Dentists are obligated to
provide emergency care and to avoid discriminatory refusal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question addresses the ethical and
legal obligations of a dentist. * <strong>The Obligation (D):</strong>
Dentists have a fundamental obligation to provide <strong>emergency
care</strong> to alleviate pain or treat life-threatening conditions for
any patient, regardless of their ability to pay at that moment.
Furthermore, dentists are obligated to <strong>avoid discriminatory
refusal</strong> of care. A dentist cannot refuse to treat a patient
based on their race, religion, disability, or medical status (like being
HIV-positive). * <strong>The Limits:</strong> * (A) Dentists are
<strong>not</strong> obligated to treat every person who requests
<em>routine</em> care. They can refuse a patient for valid reasons
(e.g., the patient is abusive, the requested treatment is beyond the
dentist’s skill level, the patient refuses to pay for services). * (B)
Denial of treatment cannot be for “any reason”; it must be for a valid,
non-discriminatory reason. * (C) Refusing to treat patients without
insurance is a form of discrimination and is unethical.</p>

<p>A patient presents with a persistent metallic taste. They have
amalgam restorations and are currently taking metronidazole. What is the
most appropriate management? A. Replace the amalgam restorations with
composite. B. Polish the amalgam restorations to reduce corrosion.
<strong>C. Advise the patient that the taste alteration is likely
drug-related.</strong> D. Discontinue metronidazole and prescribe
another antibiotic.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>The Culprit:</strong> A
<strong>metallic taste</strong> is a well-known and common adverse
effect of the antibiotic <strong>metronidazole</strong>. * <strong>The
Management (C):</strong> The most appropriate first step is to recognize
this common side effect and <strong>reassure the patient</strong>. You
should advise them that this is a temporary side effect of their
medication and will resolve once they finish their course of treatment.
* <strong>Incorrect Actions:</strong> * (A, B) The amalgam restorations
are not the cause. Replacing or polishing them would be unnecessary and
inappropriate. * (D) A dentist should <strong>never</strong> advise a
patient to discontinue a medication prescribed by their physician for a
systemic condition.</p>

<h3 id="question-178">Question 178:</h3>
<p>Which dental material is most suitable for a crown on a molar in a
patient with bruxism? A. Lithium disilicate B. Feldspathic porcelain
<strong>C. 3Y Monolithic Zirconia</strong> D. 5Y Monolithic Zirconia E.
Porcelain-fused-to-zirconia (PFZ)</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The choice of material for a bruxer
must prioritize strength and fracture resistance. * <strong>Monolithic
Zirconia:</strong> This is the material of choice. “Monolithic” means it
is milled from a solid block of zirconia with no weaker porcelain layer
on top, making it extremely strong and resistant to fracture. *
<strong>3Y vs. 5Y Zirconia:</strong> Zirconia is stabilized with yttria.
* <strong>3Y Zirconia</strong> (containing 3 mol% yttria) is the
strongest but most opaque (least aesthetic) type of zirconia. *
<strong>5Y Zirconia</strong> (containing 5 mol% yttria) is more
translucent and aesthetic but is significantly weaker than 3Y. *
<strong>Conclusion (C):</strong> For a molar in a bruxism patient where
strength is the absolute priority, <strong>3Y monolithic
zirconia</strong> is the most suitable material. A PFZ crown (E) is
contraindicated as the porcelain layer would likely chip off.</p>

<p>After placing a rubber dam, the interdental papillae are protruding
from beneath the dam. What is the most likely reason? A. The rubber dam
is overstretched by the frame. B. The holes were punched too far apart.
<strong>C. The holes were punched too close together.</strong> D. A
lightweight rubber dam was used.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The spacing of the holes in the rubber
dam is critical for proper isolation. * <strong>Holes Too Close
(C):</strong> If the holes are punched too close to each other, there is
not enough rubber dam material between the teeth to properly stretch
over the interdental papilla and invert into the sulcus. This lack of
material causes the dam to stretch tautly between the teeth, leaving the
papilla exposed and protruding from underneath. This also increases the
risk of leakage. * <strong>Holes Too Far Apart (B):</strong> If the
holes are too far apart, there will be excess rubber dam material
between the teeth, leading to bunching and wrinkling, which can obstruct
access.</p>

<p>What should be considered prior to the application of glass ionomer
in a deep cavity close to the pulp? A. No specific considerations are
required. B. Etch with 37% phosphoric acid. <strong>C. Apply polyacrylic
acid conditioner.</strong> D. Etch with 10% hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Glass ionomer (GI) bonds chemically to
tooth structure, but the surface must be properly conditioned first. *
<strong>Smear Layer Removal:</strong> To achieve a strong chemical bond,
the smear layer created during cavity preparation must be removed. *
<strong>Conditioning (C):</strong> The standard conditioner for GI is a
weak acid, <strong>10-20% polyacrylic acid</strong>. It is applied for a
short time (10-20 seconds) to remove the smear layer without
aggressively etching the dentin or opening the dentinal tubules. This
cleans the surface and makes it receptive to the chemical bond. *
<strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> * (B) 37% phosphoric acid is too
aggressive. It is used for composite bonding and would over-etch the
dentin for a GI application, potentially weakening the bond. * (A) A
consideration <em>is</em> required: you need to condition the tooth.
Furthermore, in a deep cavity close to the pulp, a
<strong>liner</strong> (like calcium hydroxide or MTA) should be placed
<em>before</em> conditioning and placing the GI. The conditioning step
itself is still necessary.</p>

started chemotherapy. What is the most appropriate frequency for taking
new bitewing radiographs? A. 6-12 months <strong>B. 6-18 months</strong>
C. 18-36 months D. 24-48 months</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Radiograph frequency is determined by
the patient’s <strong>caries risk</strong>. * <strong>Risk
Assessment:</strong> A patient undergoing chemotherapy often experiences
xerostomia (dry mouth), which dramatically increases their risk for
caries. According to caries risk assessment guidelines, a patient
undergoing chemotherapy is automatically considered to be at
<strong>high caries risk</strong>. * <strong>The Guideline:</strong> The
ADA/FDA guidelines for a high-risk adult patient recommend taking
bitewing radiographs every <strong>6 to 18 months</strong>. * Even
though the patient was previously low-risk, their new medical status
changes their risk category, and the radiographic recall interval must
be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>In which environment would you most likely find a microbial profile
dominated by gram-negative anaerobic rods and motile spirochetes,
particularly from the red and orange complexes? A. Supragingival biofilm
in a patient with generalized gingivitis. B. Subgingival plaque in a
healthy individual. <strong>C. Periodontal pockets with &gt;5mm probing
depths.</strong> D. Calculus on the lingual surface of mandibular
anterior teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question relates to the Socransky
microbial complexes and the shift from health to disease. *
<strong>Health:</strong> Healthy sites are dominated by gram-positive,
facultative bacteria (blue and yellow complexes). *
<strong>Gingivitis:</strong> There is a shift towards a mix of
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. * <strong>Periodontitis
(C):</strong> The deep, anaerobic environment of a periodontal pocket
(&gt;5mm) is the ideal habitat for the most pathogenic bacteria. This
environment is dominated by <strong>gram-negative, anaerobic rods and
spirochetes</strong>, which make up the <strong>red and orange
complexes</strong> (e.g., <em>P. gingivalis</em>, <em>T. forsythia</em>,
<em>T. denticola</em>). These are the bacteria most strongly associated
with attachment loss and bone destruction.</p>

<p>An endodontically treated maxillary first molar is to receive an
all-ceramic crown. What is the most appropriate margin design? A. 0.5mm
chamfer margin <strong>B. 1.0mm shoulder margin</strong> C. 1.0mm
feather edge margin D. 1.5mm shoulder margin</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Margin design is dictated by the
material requirements for strength and aesthetics. * <strong>All-Ceramic
Crowns:</strong> Materials like lithium disilicate or zirconia require a
certain bulk of material at the margin to resist fracture. They cannot
be thinned to a knife-edge. * <strong>The Guideline (B):</strong> The
standard recommendation for an all-ceramic crown is a <strong>shoulder
margin</strong> (or a deep chamfer, which is functionally similar) with
a width of approximately <strong>1.0 mm</strong>. This provides adequate
support for the ceramic material. * <strong>Incorrect Options:</strong>
* (A) 0.5mm is for full metal crowns. * (C) Feather edge is for metal
crowns only. * (D) 1.5mm is the requirement for a
porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crown, which needs more space to
accommodate both the metal coping and the overlying porcelain.</p>

<p>What is the most appropriate management of a tissue-colored
overgrowth on the buccal mucosa that bothers the patient when they eat?
A. Incisional biopsy <strong>B. Excisional biopsy</strong> C. Topical
antifungals D. Observe and monitor</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The
description (tissue-colored, history of being bitten) is a classic
presentation of a <strong>traumatic fibroma</strong> or irritation
fibroma. This is a benign, reactive lesion. * <strong>Management
(B):</strong> The definitive treatment for a benign, localized lesion
like a fibroma is <strong>excisional biopsy</strong>. This means the
entire lesion is surgically removed and then sent for histopathologic
examination to confirm the diagnosis. * <strong>Incisional
vs. Excisional:</strong> An incisional biopsy (removing only a piece of
the lesion) is reserved for large lesions or lesions that are suspected
of being malignant. For a small, clearly benign lesion, complete
excision is both diagnostic and therapeutic.</p>

<p>A free gingival graft (FGG) procedure is contraindicated in which
case? A. Mid-buccal recession on tooth #16. B. An implant at #46 with
only 2mm of keratinized tissue. <strong>C. A previously treated
periodontitis patient with generalized interproximal and palatal 4mm
recession.</strong> D. Recession on a mandibular incisor in a patient
with a history of aggressive tooth brushing.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The primary goal of a free gingival
graft is to increase the zone of attached/keratinized tissue. While it
can achieve some root coverage, its success is highly dependent on the
blood supply and the type of defect. * <strong>The Contraindication
(C):</strong> A patient with <strong>generalized interproximal
recession</strong> falls into Miller Class III or IV. In these cases,
the blood supply from the interdental papillae has been compromised, and
it is impossible to achieve complete root coverage. An FGG would have a
very poor and unpredictable outcome for root coverage in such a
widespread, advanced defect. * <strong>The Indications (A, B,
D):</strong> * (A, D) An FGG can be used to treat localized mid-buccal
recession, especially in non-aesthetic areas like the mandibular
incisors or maxillary molars. * (B) This is a classic indication for an
FGG: to increase the width of keratinized tissue around an implant to
prevent future recession.</p>

initiate interceptive orthodontic treatment? <strong>A. It should be
initiated immediately.</strong> B. It should be initiated in 9-12 months
when all permanent teeth have erupted. C. It should be initiated after
growth is complete. D. It should have been initiated in the early mixed
dentition.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The timing of growth modification
depends on the type of malocclusion. * <strong>The
Malocclusion:</strong> This is a <strong>Class II malocclusion</strong>
caused by a deficient mandible. The treatment goal is to use a
functional appliance (like a Twin Block or Herbst) to encourage forward
mandibular growth. * <strong>The Timing:</strong> Treatment for Class II
malocclusions is most effective when timed to coincide with the
patient’s <strong>pre-pubertal growth spurt</strong>. A 12-year-old
female is typically in the late mixed dentition and entering this peak
growth period. * <strong>Conclusion (A):</strong> Therefore, treatment
should be initiated <strong>immediately</strong> to take full advantage
of this growth potential. Waiting until all permanent teeth have erupted
(B) or until growth is complete (C) would miss the window for effective
orthopedic correction. Early mixed dentition (D) is the ideal timing for
Class III treatment, not Class II.</p>

<p>A 39-year-old patient reports recent anxiety, a feeling of her heart
beating fast (palpitations), and weight loss. Which condition is
suspected? A. Hypothyroidism <strong>B. Hyperthyroidism</strong> C.
Cushing’s syndrome D. Addison’s disease</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>The Symptoms:</strong>
Anxiety, palpitations, and weight loss are classic signs of an
<strong>overactive metabolic state</strong>. *
<strong>Hyperthyroidism:</strong> This condition is caused by an excess
of thyroid hormone, which acts as the body’s accelerator. It speeds up
metabolism, leading to symptoms like weight loss (despite increased
appetite), heat intolerance, nervousness/anxiety, and
tachycardia/palpitations. * <strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> would cause
the opposite: weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, and
bradycardia.</p>

<p>Which of the following explains the mechanism of action of caries
detecting dyes? A. Caries detecting dyes stain infected dentin only. B.
Caries detecting dyes stain affected dentin only. <strong>C. Caries
detecting dyes stain demineralized dentin.</strong> D. Caries detecting
dyes stain infected and affected dentin only.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Caries detecting dyes are not as
specific as their name implies. * <strong>The Mechanism (C):</strong>
These dyes do not specifically stain bacteria. They bind to and stain
the <strong>porous, demineralized collagen matrix</strong> of dentin. *
<strong>The Problem:</strong> Both <strong>infected dentin</strong>
(which is full of bacteria and must be removed) and <strong>affected
dentin</strong> (which is demineralized but sterile and remineralizable,
and should be preserved) are demineralized. * <strong>The Clinical
Consequence:</strong> Because the dye stains both infected and affected
dentin, relying on it to guide excavation leads to the
<strong>over-removal of tooth structure</strong>, as the clinician will
remove the sound but stained affected dentin. For this reason, their use
is generally no longer recommended.</p>

<p>A patient is taking lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) and
hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Which is the least appropriate
analgesic to prescribe? <strong>A. Ibuprofen</strong> B. Naproxen C.
Acetaminophen D. Acetaminophen with codeine</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question is about the interaction
between NSAIDs and certain antihypertensive medications. * <strong>The
Interaction:</strong> NSAIDs can interfere with the production of
prostaglandins, which play a role in regulating renal blood flow and
sodium excretion. This interference can <strong>reduce the effectiveness
of antihypertensive drugs</strong>, particularly ACE inhibitors and
beta-blockers, potentially leading to an increase in blood pressure. *
<strong>NSAID Differences:</strong> While all NSAIDs can have this
effect, studies have shown that <strong>ibuprofen</strong> has a more
pronounced interaction than <strong>naproxen</strong>. Therefore, if an
NSAID must be used in a hypertensive patient, naproxen is considered a
relatively safer choice. * <strong>Conclusion (A):</strong> Ibuprofen is
the <strong>least appropriate</strong> choice among the NSAIDs.
Acetaminophen (C, D) does not have this interaction and is a safe
alternative for pain relief in these patients.</p>

<p>A patient with missing mandibular molars bilaterally requires an RPD.
Which indirect retainer location would be the most appropriate? A.
Distal occlusal rest on tooth #45 B. Mesial occlusal rest on tooth #35
<strong>C. Cingulum rest on tooth #33</strong> D. Distal occlusal rest
on tooth #44</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An indirect retainer is a component
(usually a rest) designed to counteract the lifting forces on a distal
extension base. * <strong>The Rule:</strong> To be most effective, the
indirect retainer must be placed on the opposite side of the fulcrum
line from the distal extension and <strong>as far away from the fulcrum
line as possible</strong>. * <strong>The Fulcrum Line:</strong> In a
bilateral distal extension case (Kennedy Class I), the fulcrum line
connects the most posterior rests on the terminal abutment teeth (e.g.,
#34 and #44). * <strong>The Location (C):</strong> To get as far
anteriorly as possible from this fulcrum line, the ideal location for an
indirect retainer is a <strong>cingulum rest on a canine</strong> (like
tooth #33). Placing a rest on a premolar (A, B, D) would be too close to
the fulcrum line and would not provide effective leverage against the
rotational forces.</p>

<p>A 4-year-old patient is at high risk of developing caries. Which of
these factors puts them at high risk? A. Living in an area with no
fluoride in the water supply. B. Attending the dental clinic for a
checkup twice a year. <strong>C. Having two incipient carious lesions in
the primary molars.</strong> D. Having visible plaque on the teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question uses the criteria from a
standard Caries Risk Assessment form. * <strong>High-Risk Factor
(C):</strong> The presence of <strong>any new carious lesions</strong>
within the last 24-36 months is a primary indicator that classifies a
patient as <strong>high risk</strong>. The two incipient lesions meet
this criterion. * <strong>Moderate-Risk Factors (A, D):</strong> *
Insufficient fluoride exposure (non-fluoridated water) is a
<strong>moderate</strong> risk factor. * Visible plaque is a
<strong>moderate</strong> risk factor. * <strong>Low-Risk Factor
(B):</strong> Having a regular “dental home” is a protective, low-risk
factor. * Even though the patient has moderate risk factors, the
presence of a single high-risk factor automatically places them in the
high-risk category.</p>

<p>A 10-year-old patient experienced a complicated crown fracture of
tooth #11 <em>the previous day</em>. What is the most appropriate
management? A. Direct pulp capping <strong>B. Partial pulpotomy (Cvek
pulpotomy)</strong> C. Cervical pulpotomy D. Apexification</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question tests the management of
traumatic pulp exposures based on the <strong>size and age</strong> of
the exposure. * <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> “Complicated crown fracture”
means there is pulp exposure. “The previous day” means the exposure is
<strong>more than 24 hours old</strong>. * <strong>The
Guideline:</strong> * <strong>Direct Pulp Cap:</strong> Is only
indicated for <em>recent</em> (less than 24 hours) and <em>pinpoint</em>
exposures. * <strong>Partial Pulpotomy:</strong> Is indicated for larger
exposures or for exposures that are <strong>older than 24
hours</strong>. The procedure involves removing the superficial 1-2mm of
inflamed pulp tissue to reach healthy tissue before placing a capping
material. * <strong>Conclusion (B):</strong> Because the exposure
occurred “the previous day,” it is no longer considered recent.
Therefore, a <strong>partial pulpotomy</strong> is the indicated
treatment to remove the superficially contaminated pulp tissue,
regardless of the size of the exposure or the status of the apex (open

radiographs show the alveolar bone is at the level of the CEJ. What is
the most appropriate management? A. Application of porcelain veneers
<strong>B. Crown lengthening</strong> C. Orthodontic extrusion D.
Connective tissue graft</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>The Diagnosis:</strong> The
finding of the alveolar bone crest being at the same level as the
cementoenamel junction (CEJ) is the key. This is the diagnosis of
<strong>altered passive eruption</strong>. Normally, the bone should be
1-2mm apical to the CEJ. Because the bone is too high, the gingiva is
also too high, covering part of the anatomical crown and making the
teeth appear short. * <strong>The Treatment (B):</strong> The only way
to correct this is to surgically move the bone and gingiva to their
correct apical position. This procedure is called <strong>crown
lengthening</strong>, which involves raising a flap, performing an
ostectomy (removing supporting bone) to re-establish the correct
distance between the bone crest and the CEJ, and then apically
repositioning the flap. * <strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> Veneers
(A) or orthodontic extrusion (C) would make the teeth appear longer but
would not correct the underlying problem of the high gingival levels,
thus failing to treat the “gummy smile.”</p>

<h3 id="question-194">Question 194:</h3>
<p>For a complete denture case, grooves are placed on the labial/buccal
surfaces of the wax rims. What is the purpose of these grooves? A. To
lock the maxillary rim against the mandibular rim. B. To prevent
posterior interferences during mounting. <strong>C. To provide a
repeatable position in vertical and horizontal planes.</strong> D. To
guide the placement of the anterior teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> These grooves are part of a technique
for verifying the centric relation (CR) record. * <strong>The
Technique:</strong> After an initial CR record is made, V-shaped grooves
are cut into the maxillary wax rim. The patient is asked to close
repeatedly into the CR position. * <strong>The Purpose (C):</strong>
Each time the patient closes correctly, the pointed cusps of the
mandibular wax rim should fit perfectly and repeatedly into the V-shaped
grooves of the maxillary rim. This provides a <strong>visual
check</strong> to confirm that the recorded centric relation position is
<strong>accurate and repeatable</strong> both vertically and
horizontally. If the rims meet differently each time, the CR record is
not reliable. Notches (A) are used to lock the rims together once the
record is made.</p>

<h3 id="question-195">Question 195:</h3>
<p>All of the following classes of drugs are useful in improving the
secretion of saliva EXCEPT: <strong>A. Muscarinic antagonists</strong>
B. Muscarinic agonists C. Cholinesterase inhibitors
(Anticholinesterases) D. Parasympathomimetics</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Saliva secretion is primarily under the
control of the <strong>parasympathetic nervous system</strong>, which
uses <strong>acetylcholine</strong> acting on <strong>muscarinic
receptors</strong>. Any drug that enhances this pathway will increase
salivation. * <strong>Muscarinic Antagonists (A):</strong> These drugs
(like atropine, scopolamine) <strong>block</strong> the muscarinic
receptors. By blocking the action of acetylcholine, they
<strong>inhibit</strong> parasympathetic activity, leading to xerostomia
(dry mouth). This is the correct “except” answer. * <strong>The
Sialogogues (B, C, D):</strong> * <strong>Muscarinic agonists</strong>
(e.g., pilocarpine, cevimeline) directly stimulate the receptors,
increasing salivation. * <strong>Cholinesterase inhibitors</strong>
prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, increasing its availability to
stimulate the receptors. * <strong>Parasympathomimetics</strong> is a
general term for drugs that mimic or enhance the parasympathetic
system.</p>

<p>Which instrumentation technique is most appropriate for use with
rotary endodontic systems? A. Step-back technique <strong>B. Crown-down
technique</strong> C. Watch-winding technique D. Balanced force
technique</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>Rotary Systems:</strong>
Rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) files are designed to be used in a
specific manner to maximize their efficiency and safety. *
<strong>Crown-Down Technique (B):</strong> This is the standard
technique for rotary instrumentation. The clinician starts by shaping
the coronal and middle thirds of the canal with larger files first, and
then progresses apically with smaller files. *
<strong>Advantages:</strong> This approach removes coronal interferences
early, reduces stress on the file tips, allows for better irrigant
penetration, and minimizes the extrusion of debris beyond the apex. *
<strong>Other options (A, C, D)</strong> are techniques developed for
and used with manual, stainless steel hand files.</p>

<h3 id="question-197">Question 197:</h3>
<p>A patient develops a fluctuant abscess adjacent to a surgical site a
few days after a crown lengthening procedure. What is the most likely
reason? A. Failure of the crown lengthening procedure. B. Failure of the
endodontic treatment. <strong>C. Accumulation of debris under the
periosteum during the crown lengthening procedure.</strong> D. Suturing
the gingival tissues under tension.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> * <strong>The Procedure:</strong> Crown
lengthening involves raising a <strong>full-thickness flap</strong> and
removing bone with a bur. * <strong>The Complication:</strong> This
process creates bone and tooth debris. If the surgical site is not
<strong>thoroughly irrigated with saline</strong> before the flap is
sutured back into place, this debris can get trapped under the flap. *
<strong>The Result (C):</strong> This trapped debris acts as a foreign
body, leading to an inflammatory response and the formation of a
<strong>subperiosteal abscess</strong>. * <strong>Incorrect
Options:</strong> “Failure” of the procedure (A) would mean the bone
wasn’t removed, which wouldn’t cause an abscess. Suturing under tension
(D) leads to flap dehiscence or necrosis, not an abscess.</p>

<h3 id="question-198">Question 198:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is the most appropriate for <em>polishing</em>
composite restorations? A. Finishing diamond burs <strong>B. Aluminum
oxide discs</strong> C. Carbide burs D. Polishing stones</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> There is a distinction between
finishing (gross contouring and smoothing) and polishing (creating a
high-luster, shiny surface). * <strong>Polishing (B):</strong> The final
high-gloss polish on a composite is best achieved with a sequence of
flexible discs impregnated with abrasive particles. The most common are
<strong>aluminum oxide discs</strong> (e.g., Sof-Lex discs), which come
in a series of grits from coarse to superfine. The final steps with the
fine and superfine discs create the polish. Rubber points and polishing
pastes can also be used. * <strong>Finishing (A, C):</strong> Diamond
and carbide burs, even the fine-grit “finishing” burs, are used for
initial contouring, shaping, and removing excess material. They smooth
the restoration but do not create the final high polish. *
<strong>Polishing Stones (D):</strong> These are typically used for
polishing metals or porcelain, not composites.</p>

<h3 id="question-199">Question 199:</h3>
<p>A 40-year-old patient has poor oral hygiene, good salivary flow, and
three Class II composite restorations placed five years ago. They are
taking hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. What is the patient’s
caries risk? A. Low <strong>B. Moderate</strong> C. High D. Extreme</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This requires summing the risk factors
from a standard caries risk assessment form. * <strong>Risk Factors
Present:</strong> 1. <strong>Poor oral hygiene/Visible plaque:</strong>
This is a <strong>moderate</strong> risk factor. 2. <strong>Three
existing interproximal restorations:</strong> Having multiple
interproximal restorations is a <strong>moderate</strong> risk factor.
3. <strong>Taking hydrochlorothiazide:</strong> This medication is known
to cause xerostomia. Even though the patient currently has “good
salivary flow,” the use of a potentially xerostomic medication is
considered a <strong>moderate</strong> risk factor. *
<strong>Protective/Low-Risk Factors:</strong> 1. <strong>No new
restorations in the last 36 months:</strong> The restorations were
placed 5 years ago. This is a low-risk factor. * <strong>Conclusion
(B):</strong> The patient has multiple <strong>moderate</strong> risk
factors and no high-risk factors. Therefore, their overall caries risk
is categorized as <strong>moderate</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="question-200">Question 200:</h3>
<p>Examination of a tooth shows destruction of tooth structure that can
be easily detected with a probe. Probing the deepest part reveals soft
dentin. What is the ICDAS classification and activity of this carious
lesion? A. Moderate caries, active B. Moderate caries, arrested
<strong>C. Extensive caries, active</strong> D. Extensive caries,
arrested</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question tests the definitions of
the ICDAS caries classification system. * <strong>Activity:</strong> The
dentin is described as <strong>“soft”</strong> upon probing. Soft,
leathery dentin is the clinical sign of an <strong>active</strong>
carious lesion. Hard, shiny dentin would indicate an arrested lesion. *
<strong>Severity:</strong> * <strong>ICDAS 3 &amp; 4
(Moderate):</strong> Involve a shadow in the dentin or a
micro-cavitation in enamel, but the dentin itself is <strong>not
clinically exposed</strong>. * <strong>ICDAS 5 &amp; 6
(Extensive):</strong> Are defined by a distinct cavity with
<strong>visible, exposed dentin</strong>. * <strong>Conclusion
(C):</strong> Since the probe is touching soft dentin at the base of the
cavity, the dentin is clearly exposed. This means the lesion must be at
least a code 5 or 6, which falls under the category of <strong>extensive
caries</strong>. Combined with the soft texture, the diagnosis is
<strong>extensive caries, active</strong>.</p>
