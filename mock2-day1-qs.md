Of course. Here is the comprehensive study guide on the Multiple Choice Questions from the lecture transcript, formatted for your review.

### Question 1:

A 10-year-old patient presents with frequent episodes of joint swelling and prolonged bleeding following minor trauma. Laboratory investigations confirm a diagnosis of Christmas disease. Which of the following clotting factors is most likely deficient in this patient?

*   A. Prothrombin
*   B. Fibrinogen
*   C. Factor VIII
*   **D. Factor IX**

**Explanation:**

*   Christmas disease is the specific name for Hemophilia B, which is caused by a deficiency in Factor IX.
*   Hemophilia A, also known as classic hemophilia, is a deficiency in Factor VIII.
*   Hemophilia C is a deficiency in Factor XI.
*   All three major hemophilias (A, B, and C) involve factors of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Therefore, they all result in an abnormal or increased Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT).

### Question 2:

On cephalometric analysis, the tip of the maxillary central incisor is positioned directly on the NA line. This finding most likely indicates that the maxillary incisors are:

*   A. Proclined
*   B. Retroclined
*   C. Protruded
*   **D. Retruded**

**Explanation:**

*   **Protrusion/Retrusion vs. Proclination/Retrclination:** The position of the incisor relative to the NA line (for maxillary) or NB line (for mandibular) indicates its anteroposterior position (protruded/retruded). The angulation of the incisor relative to the palatal plane (maxillary) or mandibular plane (mandibular) determines its inclination (proclined/retroclined).
*   **Normal Values:** The ideal position for the maxillary central incisor is 4 mm anterior to the NA line, with a normal range of 2-6 mm.
*   **Diagnosis:** In this case, the incisor is on the NA line (0 mm), which is less than the 2 mm minimum. This indicates the tooth is positioned too far back, making it retruded.
*   If the value were greater than 6 mm, it would be considered protruded.

### Question 3:

A 27-year-old patient presents with myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome reporting diffuse, poorly localized preauricular pain, limited jaw opening, and discomfort during chewing. What is the most appropriate initial management?

*   **A. Splint therapy**
*   B. Correct occlusal interferences
*   C. Perform arthroscopy
*   D. Administer Botox into the affected muscle area

**Explanation:**

*   The standard of care for initial management of myofascial pain is to start with the most conservative, reversible, and least intrusive treatments.
*   **Splint Therapy:** Occlusal splints (like auto-repositioning splints) are the first-line treatment. They are highly effective at reducing muscle hyperactivity and pain without permanently altering the patient's oral structures.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Correcting Occlusal Interferences:** This is an irreversible procedure and is considered a last resort, only performed after reversible therapies (like splints) have proven effective.
    *   **Botox:** This is more invasive and is not the initial treatment. It can be a useful adjunct to stop pain but doesn't address the underlying cause in the same way conservative therapy does.
    *   **Arthroscopy:** This is a surgical procedure and is far too aggressive for initial management.

### Question 4:

A 58-year-old female presents with complaints of bleeding gums and persistent dry mouth. She reports difficulty chewing and a burning sensation in her oral mucosa. Her medical history reveals she has been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome. On clinical examination, generalized gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation are noted, with probing depths ranging from 2-3 mm in multiple sites. Which of the following is the most appropriate periodontal diagnosis?

*   A. Non-plaque induced gingivitis
*   B. Plaque-induced gingivitis associated with dental biofilm alone
*   **C. Gingivitis mediated by systemic or local risk factors**
*   D. Stage I Periodontitis

**Explanation:**

*   The absence of clinical attachment loss rules out periodontitis, making this a case of gingivitis.
*   The presence of plaque and inflammation confirms it is plaque-induced gingivitis.
*   The patient's condition, Sjogren's syndrome, causes xerostomia (dry mouth). Xerostomia acts as a significant local risk factor that exacerbates the gingival inflammation caused by plaque.
*   Therefore, the diagnosis is not just simple plaque-induced gingivitis but one that is modified or mediated by this local risk factor.

### Question 5:

A patient presents to the clinic for the replacement of the lower first and second premolars, as well as the first and second molars. What is the minimum number of implants needed to restore the full contour and function of the missing teeth?

*   A. One
*   B. Two
*   **C. Three**
*   D. Four

**Explanation:**

*   The question specifies restoring all four missing teeth (4, 5, 6, 7). Key principles for multi-unit implant restorations include:
    1.  **No Cantilevers:** Terminal abutments must be supported by implants to avoid cantilevers. This means an implant is needed at the first premolar (#4) and the second molar (#7) positions.
    2.  **Molar Rule:** The first molar (#6) is a key position and should always receive an implant when it is missing in a multi-unit span.
    3.  **Pontic Span:** No more than two adjacent pontics should be used.
*   Applying these rules, implants are placed at positions #4, #6, and #7. The second premolar (#5) can be a pontic. This results in a minimum and ideal number of three implants.

### Question 6:

Which of the following will be a complication when performing a dental extraction on an insulin-dependent diabetic patient who has taken their insulin medication but has missed their breakfast meal?

*   A. Fruity smell on breath
*   B. Hyperthermia
*   C. Bradycardia
*   **D. Belligerence**

**Explanation:**

*   A patient who has taken insulin but missed a meal is at high risk for **hypoglycemia** (low blood sugar).
*   The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are distinct from hyperglycemia:
    *   **Hypoglycemia:** Cold sweats, rapid/weak pulse, hunger, and significant mood/behavior changes like confusion, aggression, or belligerence.
    *   **Hyperglycemia:** Fruity (ketone) breath, hyperthermia (fever), thirst, and rapid breathing.
*   Bradycardia (slow heart rate) is not a typical sign of either condition; both tend to cause a rapid pulse. Belligerence is a classic neurological sign of hypoglycemia as the brain is starved of glucose.

### Question 7:

A patient presented for the extraction of an impacted mandibular third molar. Radiographic examination revealed an intimate relationship between the roots of the impacted tooth and the inferior alveolar canal. A cone beam CT showed that the roots of the impacted molar are encircling the inferior alveolar canal. Which of the following procedures should be considered for the removal of the impacted molar without causing nerve damage?

*   A. Simple extraction with forceps
*   B. Flap elevation, bone removal, and complete tooth sectioning
*   **C. Flap elevation, bone removal, partial odontectomy with deliberate root retention**
*   D. Segmental osteotomy for en-bloc removal of the tooth and surrounding bone

**Explanation:**

*   When there is an extremely high risk of nerve damage, specifically when roots encircle the inferior alveolar nerve, a **coronectomy** is the procedure of choice.
*   Coronectomy, also known as partial odontectomy or deliberate root retention, involves removing only the crown of the tooth while intentionally leaving the root fragments that are in close proximity to the nerve undisturbed in the bone.
*   **Key Indications/Criteria for Coronectomy:**
    1.  Intimate relationship between roots and the IAN.
    2.  The tooth and roots must not be infected or mobile.
    3.  Sufficient bone must exist over the retained roots (at least 3-4 mm) to allow for healing.
*   This technique has a high success rate (around 95%) and significantly reduces the risk of permanent nerve injury compared to a conventional full extraction in these high-risk cases.

### Question 8:

A 60-year-old patient presents to the clinic with a complaint of discomfort in his lower right side. The patient says, "I feel discomfort every time I eat on that side." Clinical and radiographic examination showed that tooth #47 is root canal treated and restored with a post and amalgam restoration and has a large periapical lesion. Probing depth is significant on the mid-buccal is 5 mm, on the mesio-buccal is 9 mm, and on the mesio-lingual is 5 mm with a buccal grade two furcation involvement and grade one mobility. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of tooth #47?

*   A. Non-surgical retreatment
*   B. Surgical retreatment
*   C. Immediate implant placement with bone graft
*   **D. Extraction, delayed bone grafting, and delayed implant placement**

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis is Key:** The combination of findings points strongly to a **vertical root fracture (VRF)**. The classic sign is a deep, isolated probing depth (the 9 mm on the mesio-buccal) on an endodontically treated tooth, often with a "J-shaped" or large, diffuse radiolucency.
*   **Treatment for VRF:** The prognosis for a tooth with a VRF is hopeless. The only definitive treatment is extraction.
*   **Implant Timing:** Placing an implant immediately into an infected site (which this is, given the large lesion and active endo-perio issue) is contraindicated. The risk of implant failure due to residual bacteria and poor osseointegration is very high.
*   **Correct Protocol:** The correct protocol is to extract the tooth, allow the site to heal and the infection to resolve, and then perform bone grafting and implant placement in a delayed fashion.

### Question 9:

For a dentist who is HIV positive, the dentist's blood test results reveal that the viral load is undetectable. The dentist is on an effective combination of antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following should be applied to this dentist?

*   **A. The dentist can perform all dental procedures, including exposure-prone procedures, without restrictions.**
*   B. The dentist is required to wear double gloves for any exposure-prone procedure.
*   C. The dentist can only perform non-exposure-prone procedures.
*   D. The dentist must cease all clinical practice immediately.

**Explanation:**

*   According to public health and dental board guidelines, an HIV-positive healthcare worker (HCW) can practice without restrictions if they meet specific criteria.
*   **Criteria for Unrestricted Practice:**
    1.  The HCW is under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management.
    2.  The HCW is on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (or is an "elite controller").
    3.  The HCW's viral load is consistently undetectable.
*   Since this dentist meets all criteria, there are no restrictions on their practice based on their HIV status alone. Routine infection control protocols are sufficient. Double-gloving is not required and is considered a discriminatory practice if based solely on the dentist's status.

### Question 10:

In a patient with an orthognathic facial type and well-aligned teeth in a Class I Angle classification, the patient has a 5 mm overjet and proclined anterior teeth. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's malocclusion?

*   **A. Tooth-arch size discrepancy**
*   B. Supernumerary teeth
*   C. Congenitally missing teeth
*   D. Skeletal discrepancy

**Explanation:**

*   The patient has a normal skeletal relationship ("orthognathic facial type" and no "skeletal discrepancy").
*   The problem is purely dental: the anterior teeth are proclined (flared forward), which has created a large overjet.
*   When the total size of the teeth is larger than the available space in the dental arch, the teeth must find a way to fit. The most common compensation mechanism is for the anterior teeth to procline, which increases the circumference of the arch and creates the necessary space, but at the cost of creating an overjet. This is a classic presentation of a tooth-arch size discrepancy.

### Question 11:

Which of the following flap designs is more prone to tearing during a surgical extraction procedure?

*   A. An envelope flap extending one tooth distal and two teeth mesial
*   B. A three-corner flap extending one tooth mesial and one tooth distal
*   **C. An envelope flap extending one tooth mesial and two teeth distal**
*   D. A four-corner flap extending one tooth mesial and one tooth distal

**Explanation:**

*   Adequate access and prevention of tearing depend on the base of the flap being wider than the free margin and the flap being extended sufficiently to allow retraction without tension.
*   **Mesial Extension is Key:** Access for surgical extractions is almost always gained from the anterior (mesial) direction. Therefore, the flap extension must be greater mesially to provide clear, tension-free visibility and instrument access.
*   **Correct Flap Design:** An envelope flap should extend at least **two teeth mesially** and one tooth distally.
*   **Incorrect Design:** An envelope flap extending two teeth distally and only one tooth mesially is incorrectly designed. It provides poor access from the direction it is needed, forcing the surgeon to stretch and inevitably tear the mesial aspect of the flap.

### Question 12:

After being accidentally pricked by a needle while attempting to recap it, following an inferior alveolar nerve block, a dentist is concerned about potential blood-borne disease transmission. Despite recommending the patient to undergo testing for cross-contamination, the patient refuses. What should the dentist do next?

*   A. Force the patient to undergo testing
*   B. Administer a single dose of Acyclovir
*   **C. Initiate a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen with Tenofovir**
*   D. Administer a single dose of Vancomycin

**Explanation:**

*   When the source patient's status for blood-borne pathogens (like HIV) is unknown and they refuse testing, the situation must be treated as a high-risk exposure.
*   The dentist should immediately begin **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)** for HIV.
*   The standard PEP regimen is a 28-day course of a three-drug combination of antiretrovirals. A common and recommended regimen includes:
    1.  **Raltegravir**
    2.  **Tenofovir**
    3.  **Emtricitabine** (Tenofovir and Emtricitabine are often combined in one pill, brand name Truvada).
*   Of the options provided, Tenofovir is a core component of the recommended PEP regimen. Acyclovir is for herpes viruses, and Vancomycin is a powerful antibiotic for bacterial infections; neither is used for HIV prophylaxis.

### Question 13:

A 55-year-old overweight patient was seen snoring while asleep in the waiting area of the clinic. During the examination, the patient complained of continuous daytime sleepiness. Which of the following can establish the definitive diagnosis for the patient?

*   A. Sleep assessment
*   B. Referral for an upper airway assessment
*   **C. Polysomnography**
*   D. Mandibular advancement device trial

**Explanation:**

*   The patient's signs and symptoms (overweight, snoring, daytime sleepiness) are classic indicators of a sleep-related breathing disorder, most likely Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
*   **Polysomnography (PSG)** is the gold standard for diagnosis. It is a comprehensive, overnight sleep study performed in a lab where multiple physiological parameters (brain waves, breathing, heart rate, oxygen levels) are monitored to definitively diagnose and grade the severity of sleep disorders.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Sleep assessment:** This typically refers to a questionnaire or survey (like the Epworth Sleepiness Scale). It is a screening tool, not a diagnostic one.
    *   **Upper airway assessment/Mandibular advancement device trial:** These are steps that might be taken after a diagnosis is made, not to establish the diagnosis itself.

### Question 14:

A seven-year-old patient presents with severe enamel hypoplasia on tooth #46. The patient's parents were unable to afford restorative treatment and have opted for extraction. When would be the most appropriate time to extract tooth #46?

*   A. Immediately at age 7
*   **B. Between the ages of 8 to 9 years**
*   C. Between the ages of 10 to 11 years
*   D. After the eruption of the second molar

**Explanation:**

*   The goal when extracting a mandibular first permanent molar (#6) is to allow the second permanent molar (#7) to drift mesially and erupt into the space of the #6. The timing is critical to achieve this and avoid other complications.
*   **Too Early (e.g., age 7):** If extracted too early, the developing second premolar (#5), which is not yet constrained by the roots of the primary molar, may drift distally into the extraction socket, leading to its impaction or malposition.
*   **Too Late (e.g., age 11+):** If you wait too long, the second molar (#7) will have already started its eruption path guided by the distal of the #6 and will be less likely to drift mesially into the space correctly.
*   **The Golden Period (8-9 years):** This is the ideal time. At this age, the second premolar (#5) is typically contained by the roots of the primary molar and will not drift distally. The second molar (#7) is at the ideal stage of development (bifurcation is forming) to drift mesially and take the place of the extracted first molar.

### Question 15:

A patient presented with an acute periapical abscess associated with tooth #35. Upon clinical examination, a swelling on the floor of the mouth elevating the patient's tongue and causing dysphagia was observed. The patient mentioned that he has been taking two courses of antibiotics in the last two weeks. Which of the following facial spaces is most likely to be involved?

*   **A. Sublingual space**
*   B. Lateral pharyngeal space
*   C. Submandibular space
*   D. Buccal space

**Explanation:**

*   The clinical description perfectly matches an infection of the **sublingual space**.
*   **Key Signs of Sublingual Space Infection:**
    1.  **Intraoral swelling** in the floor of the mouth.
    2.  **Elevation of the tongue.**
    3.  Difficulty with speech (dysphonia) and swallowing (dysphagia).
    4.  Minimal to no noticeable extraoral swelling.
*   **Other Spaces:**
    *   **Submandibular space:** Causes significant extraoral swelling below the inferior border of the mandible.
    *   **Lateral pharyngeal space:** Causes a large swelling on the side of the neck and severe trismus.
    *   **Buccal space:** Causes swelling of the cheek.

### Question 16:

An 8-year-old patient visited the clinic with concerns from parents about a lower second primary molar appearing infraoccluded. Radiographic examination reveals the presence of the succedaneous premolar. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   **A. Monitor and observe**
*   B. Extract the primary molar and place a space maintainer
*   C. Extract the primary molar and extrude the permanent one orthodontically
*   D. Extract the primary molar and extrude the permanent one surgically

**Explanation:**

*   An infraoccluded primary molar is a sign of **ankylosis**.
*   The standard management for an ankylosed primary molar with a permanent successor present is to **monitor and observe**.
*   **Rationale:** In the majority of cases, the ankylosed roots will still undergo normal resorption, and the tooth will exfoliate spontaneously at the correct time (or with a slight delay of up to 6-12 months).
*   **Intervention is only required if:**
    1.  The infraocclusion becomes severe, causing the adjacent teeth to tip and lose arch length.
    2.  The tooth fails to exfoliate long after its expected time, preventing the eruption of the permanent successor.
*   Since the patient is only 8, there is plenty of time for normal exfoliation to occur.

### Question 17:

Which of the following medical conditions has been shown to have a strong association with obstructive sleep apnea?

*   **A. Hypertension**
*   B. Insomnia
*   C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
*   D. Cardiac arrhythmia

**Explanation:**

*   Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a recognized cause of secondary **hypertension**.
*   **Mechanism:** During apneic episodes at night, the body experiences oxygen desaturation and surges in sympathetic nervous system activity. This repeated nocturnal stress keeps the mean blood pressure elevated. Over time, this leads to sustained hypertension even during the day when breathing is normal.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Insomnia:** Patients with OSA are typically sleepy, not unable to sleep.
    *   **COPD:** While a patient can have both OSA and COPD (called overlap syndrome), one does not cause the other. They are separate conditions with different pathologies.
    *   **Cardiac arrhythmia:** While severe OSA can contribute to arrhythmias, hypertension is the most direct and strongly established cardiovascular consequence.

### Question 18:

A patient presents with pain and restricted mandibular opening. Clinical examination reveals the following: the patient achieves a mandibular opening of 15 mm, but with mild passive force, an additional 5 mm of opening is achieved. Lateral excursive movements are normal. There are no clicking sounds. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Anterior disc displacement with reduction
*   B. Anterior disc displacement without reduction
*   **C. Myofascial pain**
*   D. Condylar subluxation

**Explanation:**

*   This is a classic presentation of **myofascial pain** (muscle-related TMD).
*   **Key Differentiator:** The limited opening is due to muscle pain and guarding ("soft end feel"). When the clinician applies gentle passive force (assisted opening), the muscle can be stretched slightly, resulting in a small increase in opening. Lateral movements are typically normal.
*   **Anterior Disc Displacement without Reduction:** This condition involves a mechanical obstruction ("hard end feel"). The disc is stuck in front of the condyle, physically blocking its translation. Assisted opening will **not** increase the range of motion. Additionally, there would be a limited lateral movement to the contralateral side.
*   **Anterior Disc Displacement with Reduction:** This is characterized by a reciprocal click and generally does not have a severely limited opening.

### Question 19:

A 65-year-old patient is scheduled for full-mouth extractions followed by immediate complete denture placement. In preparation for alveoloplasty during the surgical phase, a surgical stent is fabricated. Where is the most appropriate site for positioning the stent to guide bone contouring?

*   A. On the palatal vault only
*   **B. On the alveolar ridge**
*   C. On the occlusal surfaces of the opposing teeth
*   D. On the buccal and lingual soft tissues adjacent to the ridge

**Explanation:**

*   An immediate denture is fabricated on a cast where the lab technician has already "extracted" the teeth and smoothed the ridge. This lab-created ridge may not perfectly match the patient's ridge immediately after extractions.
*   A **surgical stent** is a clear, rigid duplicate of the fitting surface of the immediate denture.
*   Its purpose is to be placed directly **on the alveolar ridge** after the extractions. Any areas where the patient's bone is too high or sharp will cause the clear stent to blanch under pressure. The surgeon then uses this visual guide to perform an alveoloplasty, trimming the bone until the stent seats passively without any blanching. This ensures the final immediate denture will fit comfortably without pressure spots.

### Question 20:

A 63-year-old patient is suffering from liver cirrhosis. Before a planned extraction of tooth #48, the patient's coagulation mechanisms should be evaluated using which of the following laboratory tests?

*   A. Platelet count
*   B. Bleeding time
*   **C. Prothrombin time (PT)**
*   D. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

**Explanation:**

*   Liver disease, such as cirrhosis, severely impairs the liver's ability to synthesize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (Factors II, VII, IX, X).
*   The **Prothrombin Time (PT)** specifically assesses the extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade. It is particularly sensitive to deficiencies in Factor VII, which has the shortest half-life and is the first to be depleted in liver disease.
*   Therefore, a prolonged PT is the most sensitive and important test to evaluate coagulation function in a patient with liver disease.
*   The other options test for different things: platelet count (thrombocytopenia), bleeding time (platelet function, now outdated), and ESR (inflammation).

### Question 21:

Which of the following criteria is/are required for an ideal implant placement in the posterior maxilla?

*   A. The implant should be at least 3 mm from adjacent teeth.
*   B. The implant should be at least 2 mm from adjacent implants.
*   **C. The implant should be at least 4 mm in diameter.**
*   D. The implant dimension should correspond to the natural tooth dimension at the cementoenamel junction.

**Explanation:**

*   The posterior maxilla often has poorer quality bone (Type III or IV), so a wider implant is needed to achieve adequate primary stability and bone-to-implant contact for long-term success.
*   **Ideal Dimensions:**
    *   **Diameter:** The minimum recommended diameter for an implant in the posterior maxilla is **4 mm**.
    *   **Distance to Teeth:** The implant should be at least **1.5 mm** from adjacent natural teeth.
    *   **Distance to Implants:** The implant should be at least **3 mm** from an adjacent implant.
    *   **Coronal Dimension:** The implant dimension should correspond to the natural tooth dimension approximately **2 mm below the CEJ**, not at the CEJ, to allow for a proper emergence profile.

### Question 22:

An anterior open bite of skeletal etiology is characterized by which of the following?

*   A. Spacing in the mandible
*   B. Short lower anterior facial height
*   C. Shallow mandibular plane angle
*   **D. Class II skeletal relationship**

**Explanation:**

*   A skeletal open bite is caused by a vertical growth pattern, where the posterior maxilla and mandible grow downward and backward more than forward.
*   **Key Characteristics of Skeletal Open Bite:**
    1.  **Increased Lower Anterior Facial Height:** The face appears long.
    2.  **Steep Mandibular Plane Angle:** The mandible is angled steeply downward.
    3.  **Downward and Backward Rotation of the Mandible:** This backward rotation of the mandible results in the chin being positioned posteriorly, leading to a **Class II skeletal relationship** and mandibular deficiency.
    4.  **Crowding:** The lack of forward (horizontal) growth often leads to insufficient arch length and crowding in the lower arch, not spacing.

### Question 23:

If a disease has a high incidence but low prevalence, what does this indicate about the disease?

*   **A. The disease is short-lived and transient**
*   B. The disease is difficult to treat
*   C. The disease is chronic
*   D. The disease is not curable but not fatal

**Explanation:**

*   **Incidence:** The rate of *new* cases occurring in a population over a specific time.
*   **Prevalence:** The proportion of a population that *has* the disease at a specific point in time (new + existing cases).
*   If many new cases are constantly occurring (high incidence), but the total number of people with the disease at any given time is low (low prevalence), it means people are leaving the "diseased" group very quickly. There are two main ways this can happen:
    1.  **Rapid Cure:** The disease is acute and resolves quickly (e.g., the common cold). People get sick and then get better fast.
    2.  **High Fatality:** The disease is rapidly fatal. People get sick and die quickly, so they are no longer counted in the prevalence.
*   Options B, C, and D all describe conditions that would lead to a *high* prevalence because the duration of the disease is long.

### Question 24:

An 80-year-old patient presented to the clinic for vital pulp therapy. Following the application of topical benzocaine, the patient reported having difficulty in swallowing. Which of the following signs and symptoms would require immediate administration of epinephrine?

*   A. Pallor of the fingers
*   B. Confusion or dizziness
*   **C. Hypotension**
*   D. Wheezing

**Explanation:**

*   The patient is experiencing an allergic reaction, specifically angioedema (swelling, causing difficulty swallowing). The key is to determine when this reaction has progressed to life-threatening **anaphylaxis**.
*   Anaphylaxis is diagnosed when there is an allergic reaction plus involvement of either the **respiratory system** or the **cardiovascular system**.
*   The immediate treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine.
*   **Signs of Anaphylaxis:**
    *   **Respiratory:** Wheezing, difficulty breathing, laryngeal edema.
    *   **Cardiovascular:** **Hypotension** (a sharp drop in blood pressure), tachycardia, shock.
*   Hypotension is a clear sign of cardiovascular collapse and mandates the immediate use of epinephrine. Wheezing would also be a correct answer as it indicates severe respiratory distress. Dizziness and pallor are less specific and do not alone define anaphylaxis.

### Question 25:

A patient has a tumor in one of his salivary glands. Histological examination reveals a transition in the epithelial lining of a salivary gland duct from cuboidal ductal epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium. What term best describes this histological finding?

*   A. Dysplasia
*   **B. Metaplasia**
*   C. Hyperplasia
*   D. Choristoma

**Explanation:**

*   **Metaplasia:** This is a reversible change where one differentiated cell type is replaced by another differentiated cell type. It's often an adaptive response to chronic irritation. In this case, the normal cuboidal epithelium of the duct changed into the more robust stratified squamous epithelium.
*   **Dysplasia:** This refers to disordered growth and maturation of cells. It is a pre-cancerous change, characterized by abnormal cell size, shape, and organization.
*   **Hyperplasia:** An increase in the *number* of cells.
*   **Choristoma:** Normal tissue found in an abnormal location (e.g., bone tissue in the tongue).

### Question 26:

Which of the following tissues is responsible for the differentiation of ectomesenchymal cells of the dental papilla into odontoblasts?

*   A. Stratum intermedium
*   B. Stellate reticulum
*   **C. Inner enamel epithelium**
*   D. Outer enamel epithelium

**Explanation:**

*   This process is part of reciprocal induction during tooth development.
*   The cells of the **inner enamel epithelium (IEE)** differentiate into pre-ameloblasts. As they do, they send signaling molecules to the adjacent ectomesenchymal cells of the dental papilla.
*   These signals induce the dental papilla cells to differentiate into odontoblasts, which then begin to lay down the first layer of dentin. This dentin, in turn, signals the pre-ameloblasts to fully mature into ameloblasts and begin laying down enamel.

### Question 27:

A patient came to the clinic complaining of pain and swelling in the right temporomandibular joint. A CT scan revealed the presence of a unilateral radiopaque opacity adjacent to the condyle. The condylar head and neck were intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Rheumatoid arthritis
*   B. Osteoarthritis
*   C. Osteosarcoma
*   **D. Synovial chondromatosis**

**Explanation:**

*   **Synovial Chondromatosis:** This is a benign condition where cartilaginous nodules form within the synovial membrane of the joint. These nodules can detach and float freely in the joint space ("joint mice") and may calcify, appearing as multiple small radiopaque bodies on a CT scan. The key feature is that the condyle itself remains intact, unlike in degenerative or malignant diseases.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Rheumatoid/Osteoarthritis:** These are degenerative diseases that would show erosion, flattening, or osteophyte formation on the condylar surface itself.
    *   **Osteosarcoma:** This is a highly aggressive malignant tumor that would present as a large, destructive lesion of the bone, not small, distinct opacities with an intact condyle.

### Question 28:

A study investigates the association between smoking and the risk of developing periodontitis. The overall odds ratio is 2.5. After stratifying by vitamin C intake, the odds ratio is 4.0 for individuals with low vitamin C and 1.2 in those with high vitamin C. Which of the following best explains the difference in these findings?

*   A. Confounding
*   **B. Effect modification**
*   C. Selection bias
*   D. Misclassification bias

**Explanation:**

*   **Effect Modification:** This occurs when the effect of an exposure (smoking) on an outcome (periodontitis) is different at different levels of a third variable (vitamin C intake). The third variable modifies the primary effect. Here, the risk associated with smoking is much higher (OR=4.0) in the low vitamin C group than in the high vitamin C group (OR=1.2). Vitamin C is an effect modifier.
*   **Confounding:** A confounder is a third variable that is associated with *both* the exposure and the outcome, creating a false association. For example, if coffee drinkers were also more likely to smoke, smoking would be a confounder in a study on coffee and lung cancer. Vitamin C intake is not associated with the act of smoking itself, so it is not a confounder.

### Question 29:

A patient suffered trauma to the lower anterior area that resulted in an alveolar fracture. The fractured segment was repositioned. The cells that will contribute to the healing are mainly derived from the:

*   A. Periodontal ligament
*   B. Cementum
*   C. Bone marrow
*   **D. Periosteum**

**Explanation:**

*   The healing of a bone fracture, including an alveolar fracture, primarily relies on the formation of a callus.
*   The major source of the osteogenic (bone-forming) cells that create this callus is the **periosteum**, the vascular connective tissue membrane that covers the outer surface of the bone. The inner cambium layer of the periosteum is rich in osteoprogenitor cells that proliferate rapidly after a fracture.
*   While cells from the bone marrow (endosteum) contribute, the periosteal contribution is considered the most significant for external callus formation and stabilizing the fracture.

### Question 30:

A patient presented to the clinic for the replacement of missing tooth #11 with an implant-retained prosthesis. The patient's main concern is optimal aesthetics. If a 4 mm diameter implant is to be placed, for optimal aesthetic results, which of the following is true with regards to the apico-coronal implant position?

*   A. Placement of the implant 1-2 mm apical to the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor
*   **B. Placement of the implant 3-4 mm apical to the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor**
*   C. Placement of the implant at the same level as the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor
*   D. Placement of the implant 1-2 mm coronal to the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor

**Explanation:**

*   The goal is to create a gradual, natural-looking transition from the narrow implant platform to the wider dimension of the natural tooth crown at the gumline. This is called the emergence profile.
*   A maxillary central incisor is about 7-8 mm wide at the gingival margin. An implant is only 4 mm wide.
*   To allow for this transition to occur smoothly over a sufficient vertical distance, the implant platform must be placed significantly deeper. The ideal vertical distance is **3-4 mm apical** to the planned gingival margin (which is determined by the contralateral tooth).
*   Placing it too shallow (e.g., 1-2 mm) would result in an abrupt, unaesthetic "shelf" or an overly bulky crown contour at the gumline.

### Question 31:

Which of the following features are typically associated with drug-induced gingival enlargements?

*   A. Increased deposition of collagen and reduced collagenase activity
*   B. Epithelial hyperplasia
*   C. Increased accumulation of non-collagenous proteins
*   **D. All of the above**

**Explanation:**

*   Drug-induced gingival enlargement (caused by drugs like phenytoin, cyclosporine, and calcium channel blockers) is a complex process involving multiple tissue changes.
*   Histologically, it is characterized by:
    *   **Increased Deposition of Collagen:** An overproduction of extracellular matrix.
    *   **Reduced Collagenase Activity:** A decrease in the enzyme that breaks down collagen, leading to its accumulation.
    *   **Epithelial Hyperplasia:** An increase in the number of epithelial cells, leading to thickened epithelium with elongated rete pegs.
    *   **Increased Ground Substance:** Accumulation of non-collagenous components like glycosaminoglycans.
*   All the listed features are hallmarks of this condition.

### Question 32:

A patient presents to your clinic for the extraction of twenty unrestorable teeth and remaining roots. The patient suffered a cerebrovascular accident a year ago and is taking 150 mg dabigatran twice daily. Choose the correct statement.

*   A. Dabigatran must be discontinued on the day of the surgery.
*   **B. Dabigatran must be discontinued one day before the surgery.**
*   C. Dabigatran must be discontinued five days before the surgery.
*   D. Dabigatran should not be discontinued.

**Explanation:**

*   Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is a direct thrombin inhibitor, an anticoagulant with a short half-life (around 12-17 hours).
*   **For minor surgical procedures:** The drug is typically not discontinued.
*   **For major or highly invasive procedures:** This includes full-mouth extractions, where significant bleeding is expected. Due to its short half-life, the guidelines recommend discontinuing the drug for a short period. The standard protocol is to stop the medication **one day (24 hours)** before the surgery to allow its effects to wear off, minimizing bleeding risk while also minimizing the risk of a thrombotic event.

### Question 33:

A 25-year-old patient presented to the clinic with a 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm submucosal mass on the upper lip. Histopathological examination reveals a neoplasm composed of both glandular epithelial and connective tissue elements. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Oral warts (papilloma)
*   B. Lipoma
*   **C. Pleomorphic adenoma**
*   D. Lymphoepithelial polyp

**Explanation:**

*   **Pleomorphic Adenoma** (also known as a benign mixed tumor) is the most common salivary gland tumor. It is defined by its "pleomorphic" or mixed appearance, containing both epithelial (ductal) components and myoepithelial components within a mesenchymal (connective tissue-like) background. They commonly present as a slow-growing, firm, submucosal mass, frequently on the palate or upper lip.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Papilloma:** Is a surface lesion, not submucosal, and is purely epithelial.
    *   **Lipoma:** Is a benign tumor of fat cells.
    *   **Lymphoepithelial polyp:** Is comprised of lymphoid and epithelial tissue, often a counterpart to a branchial cleft cyst.

### Question 34:

Which of the following radiographs is indicated to check the alveolar bone level in order to perform a crown lengthening procedure on an anterior tooth?

*   A. Cone beam CT (CBCT)
*   B. Bitewing radiograph
*   **C. Periapical radiograph**
*   D. Panoramic radiograph

**Explanation:**

*   The most critical factor in determining if crown lengthening is feasible is the **crown-to-root ratio**. The surgeon must ensure that after removing bone, enough root structure will remain embedded in bone to support the final restoration (a minimum 1:1 ratio is required *after* the procedure).
*   A **periapical (PA) radiograph** is the only standard radiograph that shows the entire tooth, from the crown to the apex of the root. This is essential for assessing the overall root length and the existing crown-to-root ratio.
*   A bitewing is inappropriate for anterior teeth and only shows the coronal portion of posterior teeth. A panoramic has too much distortion for this precise measurement. A CBCT is overkill and not the initial indicated radiograph for this assessment.

### Question 35:

A patient came to the clinic for a six-month recall exam after the extraction of upper tooth #16. During the extraction, an oroantral communication developed and was treated. The patient complained of bad breath and bad taste from the socket of #16. The patient also complained of a feeling of fullness and pressure in the middle part of his face. Which of the following antibiotics should be prescribed for this patient's infection?

*   A. Penicillin V
*   B. Azithromycin
*   **C. Amoxicillin and clavulanate**
*   D. Metronidazole

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The patient's symptoms (bad taste/breath from the site, facial pressure) six months after an oroantral communication indicate a **chronic odontogenic maxillary sinusitis**.
*   **Microbiology:**
    *   **Acute** odontogenic sinusitis is typically caused by aerobic, gram-positive streptococci, for which Penicillin V is the drug of choice.
    *   **Chronic** sinusitis, however, involves a mixed flora of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many that are beta-lactamase producers (meaning they are resistant to standard penicillin or amoxicillin).
*   **Treatment:** **Amoxicillin and clavulanate (Augmentin)** is the drug of choice for chronic odontogenic sinusitis. The clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that overcomes the bacterial resistance, making the amoxicillin effective against a broader spectrum of pathogens.

### Question 36:

An 11-year-old patient presented to the clinic with his mother for a routine dental examination. Following radiographic examination, a radiopaque mass with tooth-like structures in the anterior maxilla was observed. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Complex odontoma
*   **B. Compound odontoma**
*   C. Ameloblastic fibro-odontoma
*   D. Osteoma

**Explanation:**

*   An odontoma is a benign tumor of odontogenic origin. There are two main types:
*   **Compound Odontoma:** Characterized by the formation of multiple small, malformed but identifiable tooth-like structures called "denticles". They are most commonly found in the **anterior maxilla**.
*   **Complex Odontoma:** An amorphous, disorganized mass of dental tissues (enamel, dentin, cementum) with no resemblance to teeth. They are most commonly found in the **posterior mandible**.
*   The description of "tooth-like structures" in the anterior maxilla is the classic presentation of a compound odontoma.

### Question 37:

Which of the following is the most potent corticosteroid?

*   **A. Dexamethasone**
*   B. Hydrocortisone
*   C. Triamcinolone
*   D. Prednisolone

**Explanation:**

*   Corticosteroids are ranked by their relative anti-inflammatory potency, with hydrocortisone often used as the baseline (potency = 1).
*   **Potency Ranking (Least to Most Potent):**
    1.  Hydrocortisone (Potency: 1)
    2.  Prednisolone (Potency: 4)
    3.  Triamcinolone (Potency: 5)
    4.  **Dexamethasone** / Betamethasone (Potency: 25)
*   Dexamethasone and Betamethasone are the most potent corticosteroids commonly used. Of the options provided, Dexamethasone is the strongest.

### Question 38:

A patient presents for the extraction of tooth #16. During the procedure, a large piece of bone was associated with the palatal root. Examination of the socket reveals a significant oroantral communication. A buccal advancement flap closure is planned. Which of the following statements regarding the buccal advancement flap is true?

*   A. It requires a four-corner flap extending one tooth mesial and one tooth distal.
*   B. It requires a partial-thickness flap creation.
*   **C. It requires a four-corner flap limited to tooth #16.**
*   D. Healing is primarily by secondary intention.

**Explanation:**

*   A buccal advancement flap is used to close an oroantral communication by advancing the buccal tissue over the socket.
*   **Flap Design:** This procedure requires a trapezoidal or **four-corner flap**. Critically, the vertical releasing incisions must be **limited to the extraction site** (i.e., at the mesial and distal line angles of the #16 socket). This allows the flap to be advanced and sutured over the socket without overlapping onto the adjacent teeth. Extending it mesially or distally would be incorrect.
*   **Thickness:** It is a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap.
*   **Healing:** It is closed primarily, so healing is by primary intention.
*   A key step is the horizontal periosteal releasing incision at the base of the flap, which allows it to stretch and advance without tension. The main disadvantage is a reduction in vestibular depth.

### Question 39:

Six weeks after treatment of necrotizing periodontitis, a patient presents for periodontal re-evaluation. Clinical examination reveals resolution of infection, but a persistent interdental crater remains mesial to #13. There is 5 mm of recession at the interdental papilla and 3 mm of buccal gingiva recession on tooth #13. Based on these findings, which of the following best describes the recession classification?

*   A. RT1
*   B. RT2
*   **C. RT3**
*   D. Not classifiable

**Explanation:**

*   The Miller recession classification has been updated to the RT (Recession Type) classification system, which is based on the relationship between facial and interproximal attachment loss.
*   **RT1:** Gingival recession with no loss of interproximal attachment.
*   **RT2:** Gingival recession where the amount of interproximal attachment loss is *less than or equal to* the buccal attachment loss.
*   **RT3:** Gingival recession where the amount of interproximal attachment loss is *greater than* the buccal attachment loss.
*   In this case, the interproximal recession (5 mm) is greater than the buccal recession (3 mm), which defines it as **RT3**.

### Question 40:

A patient presents with a complaint of clicking in the temporomandibular joint upon opening. The patient mentioned that he suffered from frequent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint, and upon clinical examination, the patient was found to have a mouth opening of 45 mm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of the patient's chief complaint?

*   **A. Anterior disc displacement with reduction**
*   B. Anterior disc displacement without reduction
*   C. Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome
*   D. Temporomandibular joint dislocation

**Explanation:**

*   **Patient's Chief Complaint:** The primary complaint is the **clicking** sound.
*   **Clicking:** A click upon opening and closing is the hallmark sign of **Anterior Disc Displacement with Reduction (ADDwR)**. This sound is the condyle moving over the posterior band of the displaced disc during opening (the "reduction") and slipping back off during closing.
*   **Associated Findings:** A history of hypermobility and frequent dislocation (subluxation) can lead to the ligaments becoming stretched, which predisposes the patient to disc displacement. The wide mouth opening (45 mm) is also consistent with hypermobility and rules out ADD *without* reduction, which would cause a severely limited opening.

### Question 41:

Which of the following pharyngeal arches are affected by Treacher Collins syndrome?

*   A. First alone
*   B. Third alone
*   **C. First and second**
*   D. Second and third

**Explanation:**

*   Treacher Collins syndrome (also known as mandibulofacial dysostosis) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.
*   It is characterized by developmental defects in the structures that arise from the **first and second pharyngeal (or branchial) arches**.
*   This results in characteristic craniofacial deformities, including underdeveloped zygomatic bones (cheekbones), a very small mandible (micrognathia), malformed external ears, and down-slanting eyes.

### Question 42:

Vertical root fractures are usually directed:

*   A. Mesiodistally
*   **B. Buccolingually**
*   C. Mesiobuccally and distobuccally
*   D. Mesiolingually and distolingually

**Explanation:**

*   The orientation of fractures depends on the forces applied and the anatomy of the tooth.
*   **Vertical Root Fractures (VRF):** These are most common in endodontically treated teeth, often caused by the wedging forces from posts or over-condensation of gutta-percha. These forces typically split the root in a **buccolingual** or faciolingual direction.
*   **Cracked Tooth/Split Tooth:** Fractures that originate in the crown and propagate apically (often in vital teeth) are typically oriented **mesiodistally**, running through the marginal ridges.

### Question 43:

A child is brought to the clinic with a maculopapular rash on the face and neck. The mother reports that two days earlier, the child had small erythematous macules with a white necrotic center on the buccal mucosa. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

*   **A. Rubeola (Measles)**
*   B. Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis
*   C. Varicella (Chickenpox)
*   D. Primary syphilis

**Explanation:**

*   The "small erythematous macules with a white necrotic center on the buccal mucosa" is a perfect description of **Koplik's spots**.
*   Koplik's spots are pathognomonic for **Rubeola (measles)**. They appear on the buccal mucosa 1-2 days *before* the onset of the characteristic maculopapular skin rash that starts on the face and spreads downwards.

### Question 44:

Which of the following ganglia is the most common site for the latency of herpes zoster infection?

*   A. Trigeminal ganglion
*   **B. Dorsal root ganglion**
*   C. Geniculate ganglion
*   D. Otic ganglion

**Explanation:**

*   Herpes zoster (shingles) is caused by the reactivation of the Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox.
*   After the primary chickenpox infection, the virus travels up sensory nerves and establishes latency primarily in the **dorsal root ganglia** of the spinal cord.
*   This is why the shingles rash most commonly appears in a dermatomal pattern on the trunk (back, chest, abdomen).
*   While VZV *can* become latent in the trigeminal ganglion (leading to facial shingles), the dorsal root ganglia of the spine are the most common site overall. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is the virus that characteristically establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglion.

### Question 45:

A study investigates the association between a specific dental hygiene practice and the development of gum disease. The results show an odds ratio of 0.2 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.1 to 0.3. What do these findings indicate?

*   A. Strong evidence that the dental hygiene practice leads to gum disease.
*   **B. Strong evidence that the dental hygiene practice is effective in preventing gum disease.**
*   C. Weak evidence that the dental hygiene practice leads to gum disease.
*   D. Weak evidence that the dental hygiene practice is effective in preventing gum disease.

**Explanation:**

*   **Interpreting the Odds Ratio (OR):**
    *   An OR of 1.0 means no association.
    *   An OR > 1.0 means the exposure increases the risk of the outcome.
    *   An OR < 1.0 means the exposure is protective against the outcome.
*   In this case, the OR is 0.2, which is significantly less than 1.0, indicating a **protective effect**. The dental practice helps prevent gum disease.
*   **Assessing the Strength:** The strength of the evidence is determined by how far the OR is from 1.0. An OR of 0.2 is very far from 1.0 (an 80% reduction in odds), indicating a **strong** effect. An OR of 0.9, for example, would be a weak effect.
*   **Confidence Interval (CI):** The 95% CI is (0.1 to 0.3). Since this range does not include 1.0, the result is statistically significant.

### Question 46:

Increasing the filler content of a composite resin will result in:

*   A. Decreased wear resistance and increased polymerization shrinkage
*   B. Increased wear resistance and increased polymerization shrinkage
*   C. Decreased wear resistance and decreased polymerization shrinkage
*   **D. Increased wear resistance and decreased polymerization shrinkage**

**Explanation:**

*   The filler particles (e.g., glass, silica) are the hard, inert component of composite resin, while the resin matrix is the softer, polymerizable component.
*   **Effect on Wear Resistance:** Increasing the amount of hard filler particles makes the material stronger and more resistant to abrasion and wear. Therefore, wear resistance **increases**.
*   **Effect on Polymerization Shrinkage:** Polymerization shrinkage occurs when the resin matrix monomers link together. The filler particles do not shrink. By increasing the filler content, you decrease the relative volume of resin matrix that is available to shrink. Therefore, overall polymerization shrinkage **decreases**.

### Question 47:

During the extraction of a partially impacted third molar, while sectioning the roots, a complete transection of the lingual nerve occurred. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?

*   A. Nerve mapping for three months followed by microsurgical repair if no improvement
*   **B. Immediate microsurgical repair with a 7-0 epineural suture**
*   C. Inform the patient that this is a common complication and recovery without treatment is expected
*   D. Prescribe a course of high-dose corticosteroids

**Explanation:**

*   When a nerve is known to be completely transected (cut) and is visualized during surgery, the best prognosis is achieved with **immediate primary repair**.
*   The procedure involves carefully realigning the two severed ends of the nerve and suturing the outer layer (the epineurium) together with very fine sutures under magnification (microsurgery).
*   Waiting is not appropriate because the nerve ends will retract and form a traumatic neuroma, making a delayed repair much more difficult and less successful. Nerve mapping is for cases where the injury is unobserved and needs to be diagnosed post-operatively.

### Question 48:

Which of the following statements best describes the use of a high-sensitivity test?

*   A. It confirms a disease diagnosis.
*   B. It predicts prognosis accurately.
*   C. It rules in disease when the test is positive.
*   **D. It rules out disease when the test is negative.**

**Explanation:**

*   This question relates to the concepts of sensitivity and specificity, often remembered by the mnemonic **SNout** and **SPin**.
*   **SNout:** A test with high **S**e**n**sitivity, when **N**egative, helps to rule **out** the disease. A highly sensitive test has very few false negatives. Therefore, if a patient tests negative with a highly sensitive test, you can be very confident they do not have the disease. It is a good screening test.
*   **SPin:** A test with high **Sp**ecificity, when **P**ositive, helps to rule **in** the disease. A highly specific test has very few false positives. Therefore, if a patient tests positive with a highly specific test, you can be very confident they do have the disease. It is a good confirmatory test.

### Question 49:

During fixed appliance therapy, an orthodontic bracket is inadvertently positioned too far mesially to the long axis of tooth #14 (maxillary right first premolar). In which direction is this tooth most likely to be displaced during leveling and alignment?

*   A. Distolingual rotation
*   **B. Distobuccal rotation**
*   C. Mesial tipping
*   D. Extrusion

**Explanation:**

*   When a bracket is misplaced, the archwire will try to move the tooth to a position where the bracket *would be* centered. The tooth moves in the opposite direction of the bracket misplacement to align the bracket slot with the wire.
*   If the bracket is placed too **mesially**, the wire will exert a force that causes the tooth to rotate **distally**.
*   The rotation is described from the facial surface where the force is applied. Therefore, the mesial side of the buccal surface will move palatally, and the distal side of the buccal surface will move buccally. This movement is called a **distobuccal rotation**.

### Question 50:

A 17-year-old male presents with pain and swelling in the right lower jaw. Clinical examination reveals a large MOD restoration on tooth #46. The tooth responds positively to vitality testing. Radiographic examination shows a well-defined radiopaque mass fused to the roots of tooth #46, surrounded by a thin radiolucent rim. What is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Hypercementosis
*   **B. Cementoblastoma**
*   C. Condensing osteitis
*   D. Periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia

**Explanation:**

*   This is a classic presentation of a **cementoblastoma**.
*   **Key Features of Cementoblastoma:**
    1.  **Vital Tooth:** It occurs in association with a vital tooth.
    2.  **Pain and Swelling:** It is a true neoplasm and often causes pain and expansion of the cortical plates.
    3.  **Radiographic Appearance:** It appears as a well-defined radiopaque mass that is **fused to the root** of the tooth, obscuring the root outline. It is characteristically surrounded by a thin, uniform radiolucent rim.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Hypercementosis:** Does not cause pain or swelling.
    *   **Condensing osteitis:** Is a reaction to a *necrotic* pulp.
    *   **Periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia:** Is not fused to the root (the PDL space is intact) and does not typically cause pain or swelling.

### Question 51:

A patient presented with a lower third molar that is partially impacted and has an operculum that is leading to entrapment of food. Although no history of pericoronitis was reported, what would be the most suitable approach for the prevention of pericoronitis in this patient?

*   A. Operculectomy
*   B. Glass ionomer cement sealant
*   C. Composite resin restoration
*   **D. Extraction of the lower third molar**

**Explanation:**

*   The definitive and most effective way to prevent pericoronitis is to eliminate the environment that causes it. This means removing the partially impacted tooth.
*   **Extraction** is the primary prevention method.
*   **Operculectomy** (removing the overlying soft tissue flap) is considered an incomplete and often temporary solution. The soft tissue frequently grows back, leading to a recurrence of the problem. Restorations like sealants or fillings do not address the impaction or the soft tissue operculum.

### Question 52:

What is the recommended management for a five-year-old child who snacks three times a day?

*   A. Toothbrushing twice a day with a rice-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.
*   **B. Toothbrushing twice a day with a pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.**
*   C. Toothbrushing after each snack with a rice-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.
*   D. Toothbrushing after each snack with a pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.

**Explanation:**

*   This question tests the standard guidelines for fluoride toothpaste use in children. The key factors are the child's age and the amount of toothpaste.
*   **Age-Based Guidelines:**
    *   **Under 3 years:** Use a minimal amount (a "smear" or the size of a grain of rice).
    *   **3 to 6 years:** Use a **pea-sized** amount.
*   The child is five years old, so a pea-sized amount is appropriate. Brushing twice a day is the standard recommendation; brushing after every single snack is generally not considered practical or necessary if twice-daily brushing is effective.

### Question 53:

A nine-year-old patient has atrial fibrillation and a prosthetic cardiac device that was placed nine months ago. The patient is scheduled for an extraction of a primary molar. Which of the following medications is the most appropriate prophylactic antibiotic for this patient?

*   A. Amoxicillin
*   B. Clindamycin
*   C. Azithromycin
*   **D. No antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated**

**Explanation:**

*   The key is to identify the type of "prosthetic cardiac device." A patient with atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disorder) would most likely have a **pacemaker** or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
*   According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, pacemakers and ICDs are **not** conditions that require antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.
*   Antibiotic prophylaxis is only required for a small list of high-risk conditions, such as prosthetic heart valves, a history of infective endocarditis, specific congenital heart defects, and cardiac transplant recipients who develop valvulopathy.

### Question 54:

Which of the following is/are seen in patients with left-sided heart failure?

*   A. Generalized fatigue
*   **B. Dyspnea**
*   C. Pitting edema
*   D. Distended jugular veins

**Explanation:**

*   Heart failure is divided into left-sided and right-sided, each with distinct symptoms based on where blood is backing up.
*   **Left-Sided Heart Failure:** The left ventricle fails to pump blood effectively to the body. Blood backs up from the left ventricle into the left atrium, and then into the **pulmonary circulation (the lungs)**. This leads to pulmonary congestion and edema. The hallmark symptom is **dyspnea** (shortness of breath), especially orthopnea (dyspnea when lying flat) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
*   **Right-Sided Heart Failure:** The right ventricle fails, and blood backs up into the **systemic venous circulation**. This causes peripheral signs like **pitting edema** (in the legs and ankles) and **distended jugular veins**. Fatigue is common in both but is a more general symptom.

### Question 55:

Nitroglycerin is used to treat coronary disease by:

*   A. Peripheral arterial dilation and increased preload
*   B. Peripheral arterial dilation and decreased preload
*   **C. Peripheral venous dilation and decreased preload**
*   D. Peripheral venous dilation and increased preload

**Explanation:**

*   Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator used to relieve angina pectoris.
*   Its primary mechanism of action is **venous dilation** (veno-dilation). By dilating the peripheral veins, it causes blood to pool in the periphery and reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart.
*   This reduction in venous return is known as a **decrease in preload**.
*   By decreasing the preload, the heart has to work less to pump blood, which reduces the oxygen demand of the cardiac muscle and alleviates the ischemic pain of angina.

### Question 56:

A 19-year-old female with a history of easy bruising and frequent nosebleeds is diagnosed with von Willebrand disease. Which of the following tests is most likely to be abnormal?

*   A. Prothrombin time (PT)
*   **B. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)**
*   C. Platelet count
*   D. Thrombin time (TT)

**Explanation:**

*   Von Willebrand Disease (vWD) is a disorder of both primary and secondary hemostasis.
*   **Von Willebrand Factor (vWF)** has two main functions:
    1.  It facilitates platelet adhesion to injured blood vessels (primary hemostasis).
    2.  It acts as a carrier protein for **Factor VIII**, protecting it from rapid degradation in the circulation.
*   Because a deficiency in vWF leads to a functional deficiency of Factor VIII, the **intrinsic pathway** of the coagulation cascade is affected.
*   The **APTT** is the test that screens the intrinsic pathway, so it will be prolonged or abnormal in patients with vWD. The Platelet Function Assay (PFA) would also be abnormal, but of the options given, APTT is correct. Platelet count is usually normal.

### Question 57:

An anxious elderly patient presented to the clinic for the extraction of an isolated tooth #37. Following the evaluation of the patient's condition, it was deemed best to perform the procedure under minimal sedation. Which of the following is the most appropriate to sedate the patient if the procedure was going to last for 30 minutes?

*   **A. 0.125 mg of Triazolam**
*   B. 0.25 mg of Triazolam
*   C. 10 mg of Diazepam
*   D. 15 mg of Lorazepam

**Explanation:**

*   This question tests the knowledge of appropriate oral sedatives and their doses for minimal sedation in adults.
*   **Triazolam (Halcion)** is an excellent choice for short procedures (< 2 hours) due to its rapid onset and short half-life.
*   For minimal sedation for a short appointment, the recommended adult dose of Triazolam is **0.125 mg to 0.25 mg**. Since 0.125 mg is an option and is the lower end of the minimal sedation range, it is the most appropriate starting dose, especially for an elderly patient.
*   Diazepam and Lorazepam have longer durations of action and are more suitable for longer appointments.

### Question 58:

A 90-year-old uncooperative patient residing in a long-term care facility presents with generalized gingival recession and multiple active cervical carious lesions. What is the most appropriate management approach for this patient?

*   A. Topical fluoride application
*   B. Restore the carious lesions with glass ionomer
*   C. Application of pit and fissure sealants
*   **D. Application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF)**

**Explanation:**

*   This clinical scenario is the ideal indication for **Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF)**.
*   SDF is a liquid that is painted onto carious lesions to arrest their progression. It is highly effective and has several advantages that make it perfect for this patient:
    1.  **Non-invasive:** No drilling or anesthesia is required.
    2.  **Quick and Easy Application:** Essential for an uncooperative patient.
    3.  **Caries Arrest:** It effectively stops the decay process.
    4.  **Ideal for Difficult-to-Treat Patients:** Perfect for elderly patients, those with cognitive or physical limitations, and those in long-term care settings.
*   Restoring with glass ionomer would be too difficult on an uncooperative patient. Topical fluoride is for prevention, not arresting active lesions. Sealants are for pits and fissures, not cervical lesions.

### Question 59:

A patient was given an oral benzodiazepine for conscious sedation. During the procedure, the patient suddenly stopped responding to verbal and tactile stimuli following the termination of the procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

*   A. Administer flumazenil
*   B. Provide rescue breaths
*   C. Place the patient in a Trendelenburg position
*   **D. Check the patient's blood pressure**

**Explanation:**

*   This question asks for the immediate **next step** in a sequence of emergency management. The patient has become unconscious, which is a sign of overdose/oversedation.
*   The first priority in any emergency is to assess the patient's status using the **A-B-C**s (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).
*   **A - Airway:** Ensure the airway is patent (e.g., head-tilt, chin-lift).
*   **B - Breathing:** Assess for spontaneous breathing.
*   **C - Circulation:** **Check vital signs**, including pulse and **blood pressure**.
*   Before administering any reversal agent (like flumazenil) or starting definitive treatment (like rescue breaths), you must first assess the patient's physiological state. Checking vital signs is a critical part of this initial assessment to determine the severity of the depression. Placing the patient in a Trendelenburg position is contraindicated as it can impede breathing.

### Question 60:

Which of the following arteries runs anterior to the masseter muscle?

*   A. Transverse facial artery
*   **B. Facial artery**
*   C. Maxillary artery
*   D. Superficial temporal artery

**Explanation:**

*   The **facial artery** branches from the external carotid artery, loops under the inferior border of the mandible, and then courses superiorly and anteriorly across the face.
*   A key anatomical landmark is that it crosses the mandible just **anterior to the insertion of the masseter muscle**. This is where its pulse can be palpated.

### Question 61:

An 11-year-old child fell off her bicycle, striking her chin on the pavement. She presents five days later with severe trismus, a maximum interincisal opening of 5 mm, and hearing difficulty. Clinical examination shows a significant overjet of 15 mm and a posterior unilateral right open bite. Manual palpation and radiographic examination rule out fractures of the maxilla, orbit, and mandible. What is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Unilateral left subcondylar fracture of the mandible
*   **B. Superior displacement of the left condyle into the middle cranial fossa**
*   C. Superior displacement of the left condyle into the middle ear
*   D. Fracture of the bones of the left zygomatic arch

**Explanation:**

*   A severe upward blow to the chin can, in rare cases, force the mandibular condyle superiorly through the thin roof of the glenoid fossa.
*   The bone directly superior to the condyle is the floor of the **middle cranial fossa**.
*   This type of injury, though rare, explains all the symptoms:
    *   **Severe Trismus & Open Bite:** The condyle is physically locked in the cranial base, preventing mandibular movement.
    *   **Large Overjet:** The mandible is pushed backward and locked in a retruded position.
    *   **Hearing Difficulty:** The proximity to the ear structures can cause auditory symptoms.
*   The question explicitly rules out fractures, making this intracranial displacement the most plausible diagnosis. The condyle cannot enter the middle ear, which is positioned medially.

### Question 62:

Which of the following is NOT considered when assessing the grade of periodontitis?

*   A. Smoking status
*   B. Radiographic bone loss progression
*   **C. Number of missing teeth due to periodontitis**
*   D. HbA1c levels in diabetic patients

**Explanation:**

*   The 2017 AAP classification of periodontal diseases includes Staging and Grading.
*   **Staging** assesses the *severity and extent* of the disease that is already present. This includes factors like clinical attachment loss, radiographic bone loss, and **tooth loss due to periodontitis**.
*   **Grading** assesses the *rate of progression* and future risk of the disease. This is where risk factors are considered. Grade modifiers include:
    *   Direct evidence (progression over time).
    *   Indirect evidence (% bone loss / age).
    *   Risk factors like **smoking** and glycemic control (**HbA1c**).
*   The number of missing teeth is a factor for determining the Stage (e.g., Stage III or IV), not the Grade.

### Question 63:

A 30-year-old patient presents with a complaint of a sore mouth lesion. Clinical examination reveals erythema on the labial attached gingiva, and tangential pressure on the gingiva tests negative for Nikolsky's sign. What is the most likely diagnosis?

*   A. Pemphigus vulgaris
*   **B. Mucous membrane pemphigoid**
*   C. Recurrent herpes simplex
*   D. Aphthous ulcers

**Explanation:**

*   **Erythema on the attached gingiva** is the description of **desquamative gingivitis**, which is a clinical sign, not a final diagnosis. It is most commonly associated with vesiculobullous diseases.
*   **Nikolsky's Sign:** This is when gentle pressure on clinically normal-appearing mucosa causes the formation of a blister.
    *   **Pemphigus Vulgaris:** The Nikolsky sign is **always positive** because the intraepithelial split is very fragile.
    *   **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid (Cicatricial Pemphigoid):** The Nikolsky sign is often **negative** (but can sometimes be positive). The subepithelial split is tougher and less likely to separate with gentle pressure.
*   Since the Nikolsky sign is negative, mucous membrane pemphigoid is the most likely diagnosis. Herpes and aphthous ulcers do not present as desquamative gingivitis.

### Question 64:

A patient presents with irreversible pulpitis in tooth #17, which is clinically and radiographically assessed as unrestorable. Despite being advised to undergo extraction, the patient insists on root canal treatment. If the dentist agrees to proceed with the treatment against their better clinical judgment, which ethical principle is most directly violated?

*   A. Autonomy
*   **B. Beneficence**
*   C. Non-maleficence
*   D. Veracity

**Explanation:**

*   **Beneficence:** This principle requires the dentist to act in the best interest of the patient and to promote their welfare. Performing a root canal on an unrestorable tooth is not in the patient's best interest; it provides no long-term benefit and is destined to fail.
*   **Non-maleficence ("Do no harm"):** One could argue this is violated, but the more specific violation is failing to do good (beneficence).
*   **Autonomy:** This is the patient's right to choose their treatment. The dentist is respecting the patient's autonomy but at the expense of their professional duty to provide beneficial care.
*   **Veracity:** This is truthfulness.

### Question 65:

A 40-year-old patient reports a history of pain and discomfort from the upper left molar but is now asymptomatic. Clinical examination reveals a large defective restoration on tooth #26. Radiographic examination revealed a periapical radiolucency at the apex of tooth #26 associated with the mesiobuccal root. Diagnostic testing shows no response to cold or percussion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of tooth #26?

*   A. Reversible pulpitis and normal apical tissues
*   B. Irreversible pulpitis and symptomatic apical periodontitis
*   **C. Pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis**
*   D. Previously treated and asymptomatic apical periodontitis

**Explanation:**

*   **Pulpal Diagnosis:** The tooth shows **no response to cold testing**, which indicates the pulp is non-vital or **necrotic**. The history of pain that is now gone is also consistent with the pulp having died.
*   **Apical Diagnosis:** There is a **periapical radiolucency** on the radiograph, indicating inflammation/infection in the periapical tissues. The tooth shows **no response to percussion**, meaning the inflammation is not currently causing acute pain. This defines the condition as **asymptomatic apical periodontitis**.

### Question 66:

Which of the following is the direct effect of a Humphrey's appliance?

*   A. Distalization of second molars
*   B. Bilateral palatal expansion
*   C. Unilateral palatal expansion
*   **D. Correction of an ectopically erupting first permanent molar**

**Explanation:**

*   A **Humphrey's appliance** (and its modern version, the Halterman appliance) is a specific fixed appliance used to treat an **ectopically erupting first permanent molar**.
*   This occurs when the maxillary first permanent molar gets caught under the distal bulge of the second primary molar and cannot erupt properly.
*   The appliance uses a wire with a spring or loop that is activated and placed into the occlusal surface of the impacted first molar. The force from the spring pushes the first molar distally, disengaging it and allowing it to erupt into its proper position.

### Question 67:

Which of the following is an immediate compensatory mechanism for a circulatory shock?

*   A. Hypertension
*   **B. Vasoconstriction**
*   C. Inadequate tissue perfusion
*   D. Decreased cardiac output

**Explanation:**

*   Circulatory shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion, typically caused by hypotension (low blood pressure) and/or decreased cardiac output.
*   The body's immediate response to try and compensate for this is to trigger a massive sympathetic nervous system response.
*   This response causes widespread **vasoconstriction** of peripheral blood vessels. The goal of this vasoconstriction is to shunt blood away from non-essential areas (like skin and extremities) and redirect it to the vital core organs (brain, heart, kidneys) to maintain their perfusion.

### Question 68:

Which of the following muscles will distract the zygomatic arch upon fracture?

*   A. Temporalis
*   B. Medial pterygoid
*   C. Lateral pterygoid
*   **D. Masseter**

**Explanation:**

*   "Distraction" refers to the pulling apart of the fractured bone segments by muscle forces. This is caused by the muscles that attach directly to the fractured bone.
*   The **masseter muscle** has a broad origin on the inferior border of the zygomatic arch. When the arch is fractured, the powerful downward and forward pull of the masseter will distract (displace) the fractured segment.
*   The temporalis muscle passes *underneath* the zygomatic arch. A depressed fracture of the arch can impinge on the temporalis, causing trismus, but the temporalis does not attach to the arch and therefore does not distract it.

### Question 69:

Which of the following statements best describes the reciprocal arm of a clasp?

*   **A. It should be positioned on a surface of the tooth which is parallel to the path of insertion of the denture.**
*   B. The reciprocal arm of the clasp should be tapered.
*   C. It must be located below the height of contour.
*   D. It should be flexible to engage an undercut.

**Explanation:**

*   The reciprocal arm is a rigid component of a clasp assembly. Its primary function is to brace the abutment tooth against the forces exerted by the flexible retentive arm as it passes over the height of contour during insertion and removal.
*   **Key Features of the Reciprocal Arm:**
    1.  **Rigid:** It must be rigid and not flexible. It is not tapered.
    2.  **Location:** It is located on the surface opposite the retentive arm, **at or occlusal to the height of contour** (in the suprabulge area).
    3.  **Guiding Plane:** It contacts the tooth along a guiding plane, which is a prepared surface that is **parallel to the path of insertion**. This ensures the denture moves smoothly into place without torquing the tooth.

### Question 70:

Which of the following is the hallmark of malignancy?

*   A. Refusal to evade immune cells
*   B. Inducing apoptosis
*   **C. Inducing angiogenesis**
*   D. Genomic stability

**Explanation:**

*   The "Hallmarks of Cancer" are a set of biological capabilities acquired by cells during the development of human tumors.
*   One of the critical hallmarks is the ability to **induce angiogenesis**. A tumor cannot grow beyond a very small size (1-2 mm) without developing its own blood supply to provide oxygen and nutrients. Malignant cells secrete signaling molecules (like VEGF) that stimulate the growth of new blood vessels into the tumor.
*   The other options are the opposite of what malignant cells do: they *evade* the immune system, *evade* apoptosis (programmed cell death), and are characterized by genomic *instability*.

### Question 71:

Which of the following is the most appropriate material for obturating the root canal system of a primary tooth after a pulpectomy procedure?

*   A. MTA
*   B. Gutta-percha
*   C. Zinc oxide eugenol with formocresol
*   **D. Calcium hydroxide with iodoform paste**

**Explanation:**

*   The key requirement for a pulpectomy filling material in a primary tooth is that it must be **resorbable**. It needs to resorb at the same rate as the primary tooth's root so it doesn't interfere with the eruption of the permanent successor.
*   **Appropriate Materials:**
    *   Non-reinforced Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE)
    *   Iodoform-based pastes (like Vitapex or Kri paste)
    *   A combination of **Calcium Hydroxide and Iodoform**
*   **Inappropriate Materials:**
    *   **Gutta-percha and MTA** are non-resorbable and are used for permanent teeth only.
    *   **Formocresol** is a fixative used for pulpotomies, not a filling material for pulpectomies, and its use is controversial due to toxicity.

### Question 72:

A dentulous 21-year-old patient presents with a recent extraction of tooth #27 and is seeking a prosthetic replacement. Which type of articulator and occlusal record is most appropriate for the accurate fabrication of a prosthesis to replace tooth #27?

*   **A. Hand articulation on a non-adjustable articulator**
*   B. Semi-adjustable articulator with centric relation records
*   C. Fully adjustable articulator with a facebow transfer
*   D. Arbitrary remounting using average values without occlusal records

**Explanation:**

*   This is a case of replacing a single posterior tooth in an otherwise intact dentition.
*   The patient's remaining teeth provide a stable, repeatable maximum intercuspation (MIP). The guidance for all jaw movements is dictated by the remaining natural teeth and the TMJs.
*   For a single crown or a small fixed bridge in a dentate patient, the casts can simply be **hand-articulated** into MIP. No complex occlusal records are needed.
*   A simple, **non-adjustable hinge articulator** is sufficient to fabricate the prosthesis, as excursive movements do not need to be replicated for a single posterior tooth. Semi-adjustable and fully adjustable articulators are for complex cases like full-mouth reconstructions or complete dentures where the occlusal scheme must be entirely rebuilt.

### Question 73:

During surveying for a lower removable partial denture, you identify that the height of contour is too close to the free gingival margin, making clasp placement difficult. What is the most appropriate management strategy?

*   A. Use a more flexible clasp arm.
*   **B. Adjust the tilt of the cast on the surveyor.**
*   C. Prepare the undercut with a bur.
*   D. Place composite resin to create a new height of contour.

**Explanation:**

*   The first step in resolving any issue with undercuts or heights of contour during surveying is to attempt to solve it by **adjusting the tilt of the cast**.
*   The position of the height of contour is relative to the vertical path of insertion. By tilting the cast anteriorly, posteriorly, or laterally, you can often change the survey lines to find a more favorable path of insertion that places the height of contour in a more ideal position, allowing for proper clasp placement without resorting to tooth modification.
*   Only after it's determined that no acceptable tilt can be found should the dentist move on to irreversible procedures like preparing an undercut with a bur (enameloplasty) or adding composite.

### Question 74:

For squamous cell carcinoma that is found on the lateral border of the tongue, if metastasis occurs, which of the following lymph node groups poses the highest risk of involvement?

*   A. Submental nodes
*   B. Submandibular nodes
*   **C. Jugulodigastric nodes**
*   D. Retropharyngeal nodes

**Explanation:**

*   The lymphatic drainage of the tongue is complex, but there are established patterns. The tongue is a very mobile and vascular organ, leading to a high frequency of metastasis to cervical lymph nodes.
*   While anterior portions can drain to submental and submandibular nodes, the primary drainage pathway for the mobile tongue (including the lateral borders) is to the deep cervical nodes.
*   The **jugulodigastric nodes**, located in the upper deep cervical chain (Level II), are the most common site for initial metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue.

### Question 75:

A 58-year-old male smoker presents with a thick, non-scrapable white patch on the lateral border of the tongue. The lesion has persisted for six months without change. There are no symptoms, and an incisional biopsy reveals moderate epithelial dysplasia. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   A. Observe with periodic reassessment
*   **B. Excisional biopsy**
*   C. Prescription of antifungals
*   D. Refer for radiotherapy

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** This is a leukoplakia with moderate dysplasia. Leukoplakia is a clinical term for a white patch, and the biopsy result provides the definitive diagnosis and dictates treatment.
*   **Management Based on Dysplasia Level:**
    *   **Mild Dysplasia:** Can be either monitored closely or excised, depending on clinical factors.
    *   **Moderate or Severe Dysplasia:** These are considered high-risk pre-malignant lesions. The standard of care is complete **surgical excision** (an excisional biopsy) to remove the entire lesion and prevent its potential transformation into squamous cell carcinoma.
*   Observation is not sufficient for moderate dysplasia. Antifungals are for candidiasis. Radiotherapy is for treating invasive cancer, not dysplasia.

### Question 76:

A patient with a history of angina presents to the dental clinic for root canal treatment. During the procedure, the patient experiences an anginal attack. A single sublingual nitroglycerin dose is administered, but the patient's condition does not improve. What should be the subsequent step in the management of this emergency?

*   A. Administer a single dose of aspirin
*   B. Call for emergency medical services
*   C. Administer 100% oxygen
*   **D. Administer another dose of nitroglycerin**

**Explanation:**

*   This question tests the protocol for managing an acute anginal attack.
*   **Standard Protocol:**
    1.  Stop the dental procedure.
    2.  Administer one dose of sublingual nitroglycerin.
    3.  Wait 5 minutes.
    4.  If pain persists, **administer a second dose of nitroglycerin**.
    5.  Wait another 5 minutes.
    6.  If pain still persists, **administer a third dose of nitroglycerin**.
    7.  If the pain is not relieved after three doses over 15 minutes, assume the patient is having a myocardial infarction (MI), activate emergency medical services (call 911), administer aspirin, and provide 100% oxygen.
*   The correct subsequent step after the first dose fails is to give a second dose.

### Question 77:

A four-year-old child has extensive caries causing pulp necrosis on teeth #51, #52, #61, and #62. The treatment plan is to carry out pulpectomy and restoration for these teeth under general anesthesia because the child is uncooperative. What is the most appropriate restorative treatment for these teeth after pulpectomy?

*   A. Composite restorations
*   B. Glass ionomer restorations
*   C. Stainless steel crowns
*   **D. Prefabricated zirconia crowns**

**Explanation:**

*   After a pulpectomy, a primary tooth is weakened and requires full coronal coverage for long-term success.
*   **Anterior Teeth:** While composite (strip crowns) can be used, they are not as durable for teeth with extensive decay. Stainless steel crowns have poor aesthetics on anterior teeth.
*   **Prefabricated Zirconia Crowns** are the most appropriate choice for restoring severely decayed primary anterior teeth. They offer excellent durability and superior aesthetics compared to other options. They provide full coverage, protecting the weakened tooth structure after the endodontic procedure.

### Question 78:

A five-year-old patient presented to the clinic with his parents immediately after a traumatic incident, which resulted in an apical horizontal root fracture of tooth #62. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

*   **A. No treatment is required**
*   B. Splint the tooth for 2-4 weeks
*   C. Extract the coronal fragment only
*   D. Perform a pulpectomy and restore the tooth

**Explanation:**

*   The management of a root fracture in a primary tooth depends on the mobility and displacement of the coronal fragment.
*   If the coronal fragment is **not displaced and has no or minimal mobility**, as is implied in this question where no such details are given, the prognosis for healing is good, and **no active treatment is required**. The tooth should simply be monitored.
*   Intervention (splinting or extraction of the coronal fragment) is only indicated if the coronal segment is significantly mobile or displaced, interfering with function or causing discomfort.

### Question 79:

Which of the following types of sutures may increase the risk of postoperative infection?

*   A. Non-resorbable monofilament suture
*   B. Resorbable monofilament suture
*   C. Non-resorbable braided suture
*   **D. Resorbable braided suture**

**Explanation:**

*   **Braided (Multifilament) Sutures** have multiple strands twisted or woven together. This structure creates small interstices (gaps) between the filaments.
*   These gaps can harbor bacteria through a process called **capillarity or "wicking effect"**, where oral fluids and microorganisms are drawn along the length of the suture material into the wound.
*   This wicking effect increases the risk of surgical site infection compared to **monofilament sutures**, which are made of a single, smooth strand that does not harbor bacteria. Both resorbable and non-resorbable braided sutures have this property.

### Question 80:

What is the most appropriate location to take a sample for a cytological smear to confirm the diagnosis of a herpetic lesion?

*   A. Crusted lip lesion
*   B. Perilesional area
*   C. Surface of an intact vesicle
*   **D. Periphery of an ulcer**

**Explanation:**

*   A cytological smear for herpes (Tzanck smear) aims to collect virally-infected epithelial cells.
*   **Ideal Sampling Technique:** The highest yield of diagnostic cells is found at the **base and periphery (margins) of a freshly ruptured vesicle (an ulcer)**.
*   **Incorrect Locations:**
    *   **Surface of an intact vesicle:** Will only yield normal, non-infected squamous cells from the roof of the blister.
    *   **Vesicular fluid:** Contains few cells and is not diagnostic.
    *   **Crusted lesion:** The crust must be removed first before the underlying ulcer base can be sampled.
    *   **Perilesional area:** This is normal tissue and will not contain infected cells.
*   The technique involves unroofing a vesicle and vigorously scraping the margins of the resulting ulcer.

### Question 81:

After completing an extraction on a patient a couple of days ago, the patient returned to the clinic with the complaint that he experiences sharp pain on the lower lip with normal touch. The patient has a condition that is called:

*   **A. Allodynia**
*   B. Hyperalgesia
*   C. Paresthesia
*   D. Dysesthesia

**Explanation:**

*   This question tests the specific terminology for neuropathic pain sensations.
*   **Allodynia:** Pain that is caused by a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain. In this case, "normal touch" is causing sharp pain. This is the definition of allodynia.
*   **Hyperalgesia:** An *increased* or exaggerated pain response to a stimulus that *is* normally painful.
*   **Paresthesia:** A general term for an abnormal sensation (like tingling or numbness), which is not necessarily painful.
*   **Dysesthesia:** An unpleasant abnormal sensation, which can be spontaneous or evoked. Allodynia is a type of dysesthesia.

### Question 82:

Extraction of a tooth in an outpatient dental clinic is contraindicated in which of the following cases?

*   A. A patient with a history of anaphylaxis to amoxicillin.
*   B. A well-controlled diabetic patient.
*   C. A patient with a history of myocardial infarction three months ago.
*   **D. A hypermobile tooth in an area of a cavernous hemangioma.**

**Explanation:**

*   A **cavernous hemangioma** is a large, high-flow vascular malformation. Extracting a tooth from within such a lesion is extremely dangerous and can lead to immediate, profuse, and potentially uncontrollable hemorrhage.
*   This type of procedure is an absolute contraindication for an outpatient dental clinic and must only be performed in a hospital setting with a surgical team, blood products available, and the ability to manage a severe bleeding event.
*   The other options are manageable in a standard clinic: avoid amoxicillin, manage the diabetic patient appropriately, and wait at least 30 days post-MI for elective procedures.

### Question 83:

Which of the following factors determines whether a fistula develops intraorally or extraorally?

*   A. Type of bacteria
*   **B. Location of muscle insertion**
*   C. Immune system of the host
*   D. Patient age

**Explanation:**

*   The path an odontogenic infection takes as it perforates through the cortical bone is determined by the path of least resistance. This path is dictated by the attachment points of the facial and masticatory muscles.
*   **Rule of Thumb:**
    *   If the perforation of the bone is **above (superior to)** the muscle attachment, the pus will be contained by the muscle and drain **intraorally** into the vestibule.
    *   If the perforation is **below (inferior to)** the muscle attachment, the pus will travel into the fascial spaces of the face and neck, potentially leading to an **extraoral** fistula (draining through the skin).
*   For example, an infection from a mandibular molar perforating below the mylohyoid muscle attachment will enter the submandibular space (extraoral), while one perforating above it will enter the sublingual space (intraoral).

### Question 84:

Which of the following periodontal procedures commonly utilizes a coronally positioned flap as part of its surgical approach?

*   **A. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR)**
*   B. Crown lengthening
*   C. Open flap debridement
*   D. Osseous resective surgery

**Explanation:**

*   **Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR)** is a procedure used to regenerate lost periodontal structures (bone, PDL, cementum). It involves placing a barrier membrane over the bony defect.
*   To ensure this membrane is completely covered by soft tissue (a requirement for success), the flap must be advanced **coronally** to achieve primary closure over the membrane without tension.
*   **Apically Positioned Flaps** are used for procedures like crown lengthening and osseous resective surgery, where the goal is to eliminate pockets by moving the gingival margin apically.

### Question 85:

A patient's right hypoglossal nerve is accidentally damaged during a surgical procedure involving the floor of the mouth. Which of the following is the most likely result of this injury?

*   **A. Deviation of the tongue to the right upon protrusion.**
*   B. Deviation of the tongue to the left upon protrusion.
*   C. Loss of taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
*   D. Loss of sensation to the floor of the mouth on the right side.

**Explanation:**

*   The **hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)** provides motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue.
*   The **genioglossus muscle** is the primary muscle responsible for protruding the tongue.
*   When a patient with a right hypoglossal nerve lesion attempts to stick their tongue out, the right genioglossus muscle is paralyzed and cannot push its side of the tongue forward. The left genioglossus muscle, working unopposed, pushes the left side of the tongue forward.
*   The net result is that the tongue **deviates toward the side of the lesion** (the paralyzed side). Therefore, a right-sided lesion causes deviation to the right.

### Question 86:

An article reporting the beneficial effect of using fluoridated toothpaste over a non-fluoridated one reported a p-value of 0.015. What does this p-value signify?

*   **A. The result is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.**
*   B. The result is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.
*   C. The result is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is accepted.
*   D. The result is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.

**Explanation:**

*   **P-value:** The p-value represents the probability of observing the study results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis were true. The null hypothesis states there is no difference between the groups.
*   **Alpha Level:** The standard cutoff for statistical significance (the alpha level, α) is typically set at 0.05.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   If **p < 0.05**, the result is considered **statistically significant**. This means the observed difference is unlikely to be due to chance. We therefore **reject the null hypothesis** in favor of the alternative hypothesis (that there is a real difference).
    *   If **p ≥ 0.05**, the result is **not statistically significant**, and we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**.
*   Since p = 0.015, which is less than 0.05, the result is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.

### Question 87:

Prolonged bleeding after a tooth extraction may be associated with the administration of which of the following drugs?

*   A. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
*   **B. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**
*   C. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
*   D. Barbiturates

**Explanation:**

*   **SSRIs** (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline) work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin in the brain. However, they also block the uptake of serotonin into **platelets**.
*   Serotonin is crucial for promoting platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, which are essential steps in forming a platelet plug (primary hemostasis).
*   By depleting platelets of serotonin, SSRIs impair platelet function and can lead to a prolonged bleeding time and an increased risk of abnormal bleeding, particularly after surgical procedures like extractions.

### Question 88:

Intranuclear viral inclusions are characteristic histopathologic findings in which of the following oral conditions?

*   A. Hairy leukoplakia
*   B. Hodgkin's lymphoma
*   **C. Infectious mononucleosis**
*   D. White sponge nevus

**Explanation:**

*   **Intranuclear inclusions** are aggregates of viral proteins or particles that form within the nucleus of an infected cell, disrupting its normal appearance. They are a hallmark of certain viral infections.
*   **Infectious Mononucleosis** is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In histopathology, EBV-infected lymphocytes can show these characteristic intranuclear viral inclusions.
*   While hairy leukoplakia is also associated with EBV, its histological appearance is more typically described as having "smudgy" nuclei or ballooning cells, rather than the classic clear inclusions seen in mononucleosis.

### Question 89:

In a patient with a skeletal Class II relationship, 100% overbite, and 1 mm overjet who is scheduled for orthognathic surgery, what is the main purpose of the presurgical orthodontic treatment?

*   A. Decrease the overbite
*   B. Maintain the overjet
*   **C. Increase the overjet**
*   D. Decrease the overjet

**Explanation:**

*   This patient has a skeletal Class II malocclusion (retruded mandible), but the teeth have compensated for it. The maxillary incisors are retroclined, and the mandibular incisors are proclined, which has masked the underlying skeletal problem by reducing the overjet. This is called **dental compensation**.
*   The purpose of presurgical orthodontics is **decompensation**: to move the teeth into their ideal positions over their respective skeletal bases, *before* the jaws are surgically moved.
*   For a Class II patient, this involves **proclining the retroclined maxillary incisors** and/or **retroclining the proclined mandibular incisors**. Both of these movements will **increase the overjet**, making the malocclusion look worse temporarily.
*   This increased overjet is necessary to allow the surgeon to advance the mandible forward into the correct Class I skeletal and dental relationship. The deep overbite is typically corrected by the surgery itself and post-surgical orthodontics.

### Question 90:

A patient is scheduled to start chemotherapy. Dental evaluation concluded that the patient required extraction of multiple teeth. What is the ideal timing for the extraction of these teeth?

*   A. One week prior to starting chemotherapy
*   B. Two weeks prior to starting chemotherapy
*   **C. Three weeks prior to starting chemotherapy**
*   D. Extractions can be carried out anytime

**Explanation:**

*   It is crucial to perform any necessary extractions well before the start of chemotherapy or radiotherapy to allow for adequate healing of the socket. This prevents complications like infection or osteoradionecrosis when the patient becomes myelosuppressed.
*   The guidelines state that the **ideal** healing time is **three weeks (21 days)**.
*   While a minimum of 10-14 days is sometimes cited as acceptable, three weeks is the preferred and ideal timeframe to ensure robust soft tissue and initial bony healing.

### Question 91:

Deflective contacts between the mesial inclines of maxillary teeth and the distal inclines of mandibular teeth will result in:

*   **A. Anterior deflection of the mandible**
*   B. Posterior deflection of the mandible
*   C. Lateral deflection of the mandible to the right
*   D. Lateral deflection of the mandible to the left

**Explanation:**

*   This describes a specific type of occlusal prematurity that occurs as the jaw closes from centric relation into maximum intercuspation.
*   Imagine the mandible closing. If the **distal-facing inclines** of the lower teeth hit the **mesial-facing inclines** of the upper teeth prematurely, the mandible has nowhere to go but to slide **forward and upward** along these inclined planes to reach full closure.
*   This is a classic "slide from CR to MIP" and results in an **anterior deflection of the mandible**.

### Question 92:

A nine-year-old patient presents with tooth #11 in anterior crossbite and maxillary crowding. What is the most appropriate appliance to correct the crossbite and manage the crowding?

*   A. Removable Hawley appliance with a Z-spring
*   B. Functional appliance (e.g., Twin Block)
*   C. Full fixed appliances with brackets and archwire
*   **D. Sectional fixed appliance (2x4 appliance)**

**Explanation:**

*   Correcting an anterior crossbite requires space. Since the patient has crowding, there is not enough space to simply push the tooth forward with a removable appliance like a Hawley.
*   A **2x4 appliance** is the ideal choice in the mixed dentition for this situation. It consists of brackets on the four maxillary incisors and bands on the two maxillary first permanent molars.
*   This appliance is highly effective because it can perform multiple actions simultaneously:
    1.  **Create Space:** The archwire can be used to align the incisors and distalize the canines if needed, resolving the crowding.
    2.  **Correct Crossbite:** Once space is available, the wire can be used to efficiently move the tooth in crossbite forward into its correct position.
*   Full fixed appliances are for the permanent dentition. A functional appliance is for correcting skeletal Class II discrepancies.

### Question 93:

In a patient who is taking imipramine and presents for scaling and routine dental examination, what precautions should be taken during the dental procedure?

*   A. Refer to a physician for further assessment prior to treatment.
*   B. Discontinue the use of imipramine prior to the dental procedure.
*   **C. Elevate the dental chair slowly after the procedure.**
*   D. No special consideration is required.

**Explanation:**

*   Imipramine is a **tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)**.
*   One of the most common and clinically significant side effects of TCAs is **orthostatic hypotension**. This is a sudden drop in blood pressure that occurs when standing up or changing position from supine to upright too quickly, which can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting (syncope).
*   The primary precaution for a dental professional is to **raise the dental chair slowly and in stages** at the end of the appointment, allowing the patient's cardiovascular system time to adjust and preventing an orthostatic event.

### Question 94:

During a mandibular lateral shift movement, which of the following best describes the movement of the rotating condyle?

*   A. It moves anteriorly and medially.
*   **B. It moves posteriorly and laterally.**
*   C. It remains stationary in the fossa.
*   D. It moves inferiorly and anteriorly.

**Explanation:**

*   During a lateral excursion (e.g., a right lateral movement):
*   **Working Side (Right Side):** The condyle on the side the mandible is moving *toward* is called the **rotating condyle**. It primarily rotates within the glenoid fossa but also shifts slightly **posteriorly and laterally**. This entire movement of the mandible to the side is called the Bennett movement.
*   **Non-Working Side (Left Side):** The condyle on the side the mandible is moving *away from* is called the **orbiting or advancing condyle**. It moves **anteriorly, inferiorly, and medially** down the articular eminence.

### Question 95:

Which of the following is considered the first clinical manifestation of local anesthetic toxicity?

*   A. Drowsiness
*   B. Tinnitus
*   C. Metallic taste
*   **D. Dizziness**

**Explanation:**

*   Local anesthetic toxicity affects the Central Nervous System (CNS) in a biphasic manner: initial excitation followed by depression.
*   The **earliest signs** are typically related to CNS excitation. These are often subtle and can include:
    *   Lightheadedness and **dizziness**
    *   Nervousness, apprehension, talkativeness
    *   Confusion
    *   Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and a metallic taste can also occur early but are considered more non-specific.
*   **Drowsiness** is a sign of CNS **depression**, which occurs in the later, more severe stages of toxicity. Of the options provided, dizziness is the most reliable early excitatory sign.

### Question 96:

After apicectomy and MTA retrofill, which of the following describes the normal histological appearance at the apex?

*   A. Formation of a fibrous capsule around the apex and MTA
*   **B. Formation of cementum directly over the MTA**
*   C. Insertion of periodontal ligament fibers parallel to the MTA
*   D. Direct contact of new bone with the MTA

**Explanation:**

*   Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is a highly biocompatible and bioactive material.
*   One of its remarkable properties is the ability to induce hard tissue formation. Histological studies have consistently shown that when MTA is placed as a root-end filling material, it promotes the regeneration of a new layer of **cementum** that forms directly on its surface.
*   This new cementum layer then allows for the re-establishment of a functional periodontal ligament, with fibers inserting into both the new cementum and the adjacent alveolar bone, leading to true periodontal regeneration.

### Question 97:

How frequently should dental unit waterlines be purged?

*   A. After every patient
*   **B. Once every morning**
*   C. Once a week
*   D. Only when visibly contaminated

**Explanation:**

*   This question refers to the general purging of **all** waterlines in the dental unit to reduce the microbial load from overnight stagnation.
*   Infection control guidelines mandate that at the **beginning of each day**, all waterlines should be flushed for **2-3 minutes**.
*   It's important to differentiate this from the short (20-30 second) flush of specific instruments like the air/water syringe and high-speed handpiece that is performed **between each patient**. The question asks about the "dental unit waterlines" as a whole system, for which the daily purge is the correct answer.

### Question 98:

The microbiota associated with the generalized form of early-onset periodontitis (now termed generalized Grade C periodontitis) is predominated by all of the following microorganisms EXCEPT:

*   **A. *Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans***
*   B. *Porphyromonas gingivalis*
*   C. *Treponema denticola*
*   D. *Tannerella forsythia*

**Explanation:**

*   *P. gingivalis*, *T. denticola*, and *T. forsythia* make up the "Red Complex," a group of pathogens strongly associated with severe and progressive forms of periodontitis, including what was formerly called generalized aggressive periodontitis.
*   ***Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans* (Aa)**, while a potent periodontal pathogen, is classically and most strongly associated with the **localized** form of aggressive periodontitis (now known as the "molar-incisor pattern"). It is not considered a predominant organism in the generalized form.

### Question 99:

A five-year-old patient presents with a complaint of toothache triggered by cold water. Radiographic examination reveals distal caries on tooth #74 extending to the pulp with no signs of periapical pathology or furcation involvement. What is the most appropriate treatment?

*   A. Indirect pulp capping
*   B. Pulpectomy and amalgam restoration
*   **C. Pulpotomy and stainless steel crown**
*   D. Pulpectomy and stainless steel crown

**Explanation:**

*   **Diagnosis:** The pain is triggered by cold but is not spontaneous, and there are no radiographic signs of irreversible change (like furcation involvement). This indicates **reversible pulpitis**, even with a carious exposure.
*   **Treatment for Reversible Pulpitis in a Primary Molar:** The standard of care is a **pulpotomy**. This involves removing the coronal portion of the pulp, placing a medicament (like formocresol or MTA), and sealing the tooth.
*   **Restoration:** After a pulpotomy, the tooth is weakened and requires full coronal coverage to prevent fracture. The restoration of choice for a primary molar after pulp therapy is a **stainless steel crown (SSC)**.

### Question 100:

After sedation with nitrous oxide, what is the minimal amount of time that the patient must be kept on 100% oxygen before being discharged?

*   A. 1 minute
*   B. 2 minutes
*   **C. 3-5 minutes**
*   D. 10 minutes

**Explanation:**

*   At the end of a procedure involving nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation, the nitrous oxide must be turned off, and the patient must breathe **100% oxygen** for a period of time.
*   This is done to prevent **diffusion hypoxia**. Nitrous oxide is rapidly eliminated from the blood into the alveoli of the lungs. This rapid outward diffusion can dilute the concentration of oxygen in the lungs, leading to a temporary drop in blood oxygen saturation, which can cause headache, nausea, and lethargy.
*   Administering 100% oxygen for a minimum of **3-5 minutes** effectively flushes out the residual nitrous oxide and prevents this complication.
