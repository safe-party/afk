<h1>Question & Answer Bank</h1>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Of course. Here is the comprehensive study guide on the Multiple Choice Questions from the lecture transcript, formatted for your review.</p>
<h3>Question 1:</h3>
<p>A 10-year-old patient presents with frequent episodes of joint swelling and prolonged bleeding following minor trauma. Laboratory investigations confirm a diagnosis of Christmas disease. Which of the following clotting factors is most likely deficient in this patient?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Prothrombin</li>
<li>B. Fibrinogen</li>
<li>C. Factor VIII</li>
<li><strong>D. Factor IX</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Christmas disease is the specific name for Hemophilia B, which is caused by a deficiency in Factor IX.</li>
<li>Hemophilia A, also known as classic hemophilia, is a deficiency in Factor VIII.</li>
<li>Hemophilia C is a deficiency in Factor XI.</li>
<li>All three major hemophilias (A, B, and C) involve factors of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Therefore, they all result in an abnormal or increased Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 2:</h3>
<p>On cephalometric analysis, the tip of the maxillary central incisor is positioned directly on the NA line. This finding most likely indicates that the maxillary incisors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Proclined</li>
<li>B. Retroclined</li>
<li>C. Protruded</li>
<li><strong>D. Retruded</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protrusion/Retrusion vs. Proclination/Retrclination:</strong> The position of the incisor relative to the NA line (for maxillary) or NB line (for mandibular) indicates its anteroposterior position (protruded/retruded). The angulation of the incisor relative to the palatal plane (maxillary) or mandibular plane (mandibular) determines its inclination (proclined/retroclined).</li>
<li><strong>Normal Values:</strong> The ideal position for the maxillary central incisor is 4 mm anterior to the NA line, with a normal range of 2-6 mm.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> In this case, the incisor is on the NA line (0 mm), which is less than the 2 mm minimum. This indicates the tooth is positioned too far back, making it retruded.</li>
<li>If the value were greater than 6 mm, it would be considered protruded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p>A 27-year-old patient presents with myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome reporting diffuse, poorly localized preauricular pain, limited jaw opening, and discomfort during chewing. What is the most appropriate initial management?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Splint therapy</strong></li>
<li>B. Correct occlusal interferences</li>
<li>C. Perform arthroscopy</li>
<li>D. Administer Botox into the affected muscle area</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The standard of care for initial management of myofascial pain is to start with the most conservative, reversible, and least intrusive treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Splint Therapy:</strong> Occlusal splints (like auto-repositioning splints) are the first-line treatment. They are highly effective at reducing muscle hyperactivity and pain without permanently altering the patient's oral structures.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Correcting Occlusal Interferences:</strong> This is an irreversible procedure and is considered a last resort, only performed after reversible therapies (like splints) have proven effective.</li>
<li><strong>Botox:</strong> This is more invasive and is not the initial treatment. It can be a useful adjunct to stop pain but doesn't address the underlying cause in the same way conservative therapy does.</li>
<li><strong>Arthroscopy:</strong> This is a surgical procedure and is far too aggressive for initial management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 4:</h3>
<p>A 58-year-old female presents with complaints of bleeding gums and persistent dry mouth. She reports difficulty chewing and a burning sensation in her oral mucosa. Her medical history reveals she has been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome. On clinical examination, generalized gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation are noted, with probing depths ranging from 2-3 mm in multiple sites. Which of the following is the most appropriate periodontal diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Non-plaque induced gingivitis</li>
<li>B. Plaque-induced gingivitis associated with dental biofilm alone</li>
<li><strong>C. Gingivitis mediated by systemic or local risk factors</strong></li>
<li>D. Stage I Periodontitis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The absence of clinical attachment loss rules out periodontitis, making this a case of gingivitis.</li>
<li>The presence of plaque and inflammation confirms it is plaque-induced gingivitis.</li>
<li>The patient's condition, Sjogren's syndrome, causes xerostomia (dry mouth). Xerostomia acts as a significant local risk factor that exacerbates the gingival inflammation caused by plaque.</li>
<li>Therefore, the diagnosis is not just simple plaque-induced gingivitis but one that is modified or mediated by this local risk factor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 5:</h3>
<p>A patient presents to the clinic for the replacement of the lower first and second premolars, as well as the first and second molars. What is the minimum number of implants needed to restore the full contour and function of the missing teeth?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. One</li>
<li>B. Two</li>
<li><strong>C. Three</strong></li>
<li>D. Four</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The question specifies restoring all four missing teeth (4, 5, 6, 7). Key principles for multi-unit implant restorations include:<ol>
<li><strong>No Cantilevers:</strong> Terminal abutments must be supported by implants to avoid cantilevers. This means an implant is needed at the first premolar (#4) and the second molar (#7) positions.</li>
<li><strong>Molar Rule:</strong> The first molar (#6) is a key position and should always receive an implant when it is missing in a multi-unit span.</li>
<li><strong>Pontic Span:</strong> No more than two adjacent pontics should be used.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Applying these rules, implants are placed at positions #4, #6, and #7. The second premolar (#5) can be a pontic. This results in a minimum and ideal number of three implants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 6:</h3>
<p>Which of the following will be a complication when performing a dental extraction on an insulin-dependent diabetic patient who has taken their insulin medication but has missed their breakfast meal?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Fruity smell on breath</li>
<li>B. Hyperthermia</li>
<li>C. Bradycardia</li>
<li><strong>D. Belligerence</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A patient who has taken insulin but missed a meal is at high risk for <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> (low blood sugar).</li>
<li>The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are distinct from hyperglycemia:<ul>
<li><strong>Hypoglycemia:</strong> Cold sweats, rapid/weak pulse, hunger, and significant mood/behavior changes like confusion, aggression, or belligerence.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperglycemia:</strong> Fruity (ketone) breath, hyperthermia (fever), thirst, and rapid breathing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bradycardia (slow heart rate) is not a typical sign of either condition; both tend to cause a rapid pulse. Belligerence is a classic neurological sign of hypoglycemia as the brain is starved of glucose.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 7:</h3>
<p>A patient presented for the extraction of an impacted mandibular third molar. Radiographic examination revealed an intimate relationship between the roots of the impacted tooth and the inferior alveolar canal. A cone beam CT showed that the roots of the impacted molar are encircling the inferior alveolar canal. Which of the following procedures should be considered for the removal of the impacted molar without causing nerve damage?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Simple extraction with forceps</li>
<li>B. Flap elevation, bone removal, and complete tooth sectioning</li>
<li><strong>C. Flap elevation, bone removal, partial odontectomy with deliberate root retention</strong></li>
<li>D. Segmental osteotomy for en-bloc removal of the tooth and surrounding bone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When there is an extremely high risk of nerve damage, specifically when roots encircle the inferior alveolar nerve, a <strong>coronectomy</strong> is the procedure of choice.</li>
<li>Coronectomy, also known as partial odontectomy or deliberate root retention, involves removing only the crown of the tooth while intentionally leaving the root fragments that are in close proximity to the nerve undisturbed in the bone.</li>
<li><strong>Key Indications/Criteria for Coronectomy:</strong><ol>
<li>Intimate relationship between roots and the IAN.</li>
<li>The tooth and roots must not be infected or mobile.</li>
<li>Sufficient bone must exist over the retained roots (at least 3-4 mm) to allow for healing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This technique has a high success rate (around 95%) and significantly reduces the risk of permanent nerve injury compared to a conventional full extraction in these high-risk cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 8:</h3>
<p>A 60-year-old patient presents to the clinic with a complaint of discomfort in his lower right side. The patient says, "I feel discomfort every time I eat on that side." Clinical and radiographic examination showed that tooth #47 is root canal treated and restored with a post and amalgam restoration and has a large periapical lesion. Probing depth is significant on the mid-buccal is 5 mm, on the mesio-buccal is 9 mm, and on the mesio-lingual is 5 mm with a buccal grade two furcation involvement and grade one mobility. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of tooth #47?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Non-surgical retreatment</li>
<li>B. Surgical retreatment</li>
<li>C. Immediate implant placement with bone graft</li>
<li><strong>D. Extraction, delayed bone grafting, and delayed implant placement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis is Key:</strong> The combination of findings points strongly to a <strong>vertical root fracture (VRF)</strong>. The classic sign is a deep, isolated probing depth (the 9 mm on the mesio-buccal) on an endodontically treated tooth, often with a "J-shaped" or large, diffuse radiolucency.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment for VRF:</strong> The prognosis for a tooth with a VRF is hopeless. The only definitive treatment is extraction.</li>
<li><strong>Implant Timing:</strong> Placing an implant immediately into an infected site (which this is, given the large lesion and active endo-perio issue) is contraindicated. The risk of implant failure due to residual bacteria and poor osseointegration is very high.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Protocol:</strong> The correct protocol is to extract the tooth, allow the site to heal and the infection to resolve, and then perform bone grafting and implant placement in a delayed fashion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 9:</h3>
<p>For a dentist who is HIV positive, the dentist's blood test results reveal that the viral load is undetectable. The dentist is on an effective combination of antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following should be applied to this dentist?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. The dentist can perform all dental procedures, including exposure-prone procedures, without restrictions.</strong></li>
<li>B. The dentist is required to wear double gloves for any exposure-prone procedure.</li>
<li>C. The dentist can only perform non-exposure-prone procedures.</li>
<li>D. The dentist must cease all clinical practice immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to public health and dental board guidelines, an HIV-positive healthcare worker (HCW) can practice without restrictions if they meet specific criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Criteria for Unrestricted Practice:</strong><ol>
<li>The HCW is under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management.</li>
<li>The HCW is on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (or is an "elite controller").</li>
<li>The HCW's viral load is consistently undetectable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Since this dentist meets all criteria, there are no restrictions on their practice based on their HIV status alone. Routine infection control protocols are sufficient. Double-gloving is not required and is considered a discriminatory practice if based solely on the dentist's status.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 10:</h3>
<p>In a patient with an orthognathic facial type and well-aligned teeth in a Class I Angle classification, the patient has a 5 mm overjet and proclined anterior teeth. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's malocclusion?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Tooth-arch size discrepancy</strong></li>
<li>B. Supernumerary teeth</li>
<li>C. Congenitally missing teeth</li>
<li>D. Skeletal discrepancy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The patient has a normal skeletal relationship ("orthognathic facial type" and no "skeletal discrepancy").</li>
<li>The problem is purely dental: the anterior teeth are proclined (flared forward), which has created a large overjet.</li>
<li>When the total size of the teeth is larger than the available space in the dental arch, the teeth must find a way to fit. The most common compensation mechanism is for the anterior teeth to procline, which increases the circumference of the arch and creates the necessary space, but at the cost of creating an overjet. This is a classic presentation of a tooth-arch size discrepancy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 11:</h3>
<p>Which of the following flap designs is more prone to tearing during a surgical extraction procedure?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. An envelope flap extending one tooth distal and two teeth mesial</li>
<li>B. A three-corner flap extending one tooth mesial and one tooth distal</li>
<li><strong>C. An envelope flap extending one tooth mesial and two teeth distal</strong></li>
<li>D. A four-corner flap extending one tooth mesial and one tooth distal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adequate access and prevention of tearing depend on the base of the flap being wider than the free margin and the flap being extended sufficiently to allow retraction without tension.</li>
<li><strong>Mesial Extension is Key:</strong> Access for surgical extractions is almost always gained from the anterior (mesial) direction. Therefore, the flap extension must be greater mesially to provide clear, tension-free visibility and instrument access.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Flap Design:</strong> An envelope flap should extend at least <strong>two teeth mesially</strong> and one tooth distally.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Design:</strong> An envelope flap extending two teeth distally and only one tooth mesially is incorrectly designed. It provides poor access from the direction it is needed, forcing the surgeon to stretch and inevitably tear the mesial aspect of the flap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 12:</h3>
<p>After being accidentally pricked by a needle while attempting to recap it, following an inferior alveolar nerve block, a dentist is concerned about potential blood-borne disease transmission. Despite recommending the patient to undergo testing for cross-contamination, the patient refuses. What should the dentist do next?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Force the patient to undergo testing</li>
<li>B. Administer a single dose of Acyclovir</li>
<li><strong>C. Initiate a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen with Tenofovir</strong></li>
<li>D. Administer a single dose of Vancomycin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the source patient's status for blood-borne pathogens (like HIV) is unknown and they refuse testing, the situation must be treated as a high-risk exposure.</li>
<li>The dentist should immediately begin <strong>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)</strong> for HIV.</li>
<li>The standard PEP regimen is a 28-day course of a three-drug combination of antiretrovirals. A common and recommended regimen includes:<ol>
<li><strong>Raltegravir</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tenofovir</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emtricitabine</strong> (Tenofovir and Emtricitabine are often combined in one pill, brand name Truvada).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Of the options provided, Tenofovir is a core component of the recommended PEP regimen. Acyclovir is for herpes viruses, and Vancomycin is a powerful antibiotic for bacterial infections; neither is used for HIV prophylaxis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 13:</h3>
<p>A 55-year-old overweight patient was seen snoring while asleep in the waiting area of the clinic. During the examination, the patient complained of continuous daytime sleepiness. Which of the following can establish the definitive diagnosis for the patient?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Sleep assessment</li>
<li>B. Referral for an upper airway assessment</li>
<li><strong>C. Polysomnography</strong></li>
<li>D. Mandibular advancement device trial</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The patient's signs and symptoms (overweight, snoring, daytime sleepiness) are classic indicators of a sleep-related breathing disorder, most likely Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).</li>
<li><strong>Polysomnography (PSG)</strong> is the gold standard for diagnosis. It is a comprehensive, overnight sleep study performed in a lab where multiple physiological parameters (brain waves, breathing, heart rate, oxygen levels) are monitored to definitively diagnose and grade the severity of sleep disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Sleep assessment:</strong> This typically refers to a questionnaire or survey (like the Epworth Sleepiness Scale). It is a screening tool, not a diagnostic one.</li>
<li><strong>Upper airway assessment/Mandibular advancement device trial:</strong> These are steps that might be taken after a diagnosis is made, not to establish the diagnosis itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 14:</h3>
<p>A seven-year-old patient presents with severe enamel hypoplasia on tooth #46. The patient's parents were unable to afford restorative treatment and have opted for extraction. When would be the most appropriate time to extract tooth #46?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Immediately at age 7</li>
<li><strong>B. Between the ages of 8 to 9 years</strong></li>
<li>C. Between the ages of 10 to 11 years</li>
<li>D. After the eruption of the second molar</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The goal when extracting a mandibular first permanent molar (#6) is to allow the second permanent molar (#7) to drift mesially and erupt into the space of the #6. The timing is critical to achieve this and avoid other complications.</li>
<li><strong>Too Early (e.g., age 7):</strong> If extracted too early, the developing second premolar (#5), which is not yet constrained by the roots of the primary molar, may drift distally into the extraction socket, leading to its impaction or malposition.</li>
<li><strong>Too Late (e.g., age 11+):</strong> If you wait too long, the second molar (#7) will have already started its eruption path guided by the distal of the #6 and will be less likely to drift mesially into the space correctly.</li>
<li><strong>The Golden Period (8-9 years):</strong> This is the ideal time. At this age, the second premolar (#5) is typically contained by the roots of the primary molar and will not drift distally. The second molar (#7) is at the ideal stage of development (bifurcation is forming) to drift mesially and take the place of the extracted first molar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 15:</h3>
<p>A patient presented with an acute periapical abscess associated with tooth #35. Upon clinical examination, a swelling on the floor of the mouth elevating the patient's tongue and causing dysphagia was observed. The patient mentioned that he has been taking two courses of antibiotics in the last two weeks. Which of the following facial spaces is most likely to be involved?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Sublingual space</strong></li>
<li>B. Lateral pharyngeal space</li>
<li>C. Submandibular space</li>
<li>D. Buccal space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The clinical description perfectly matches an infection of the <strong>sublingual space</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Key Signs of Sublingual Space Infection:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Intraoral swelling</strong> in the floor of the mouth.</li>
<li><strong>Elevation of the tongue.</strong></li>
<li>Difficulty with speech (dysphonia) and swallowing (dysphagia).</li>
<li>Minimal to no noticeable extraoral swelling.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Spaces:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Submandibular space:</strong> Causes significant extraoral swelling below the inferior border of the mandible.</li>
<li><strong>Lateral pharyngeal space:</strong> Causes a large swelling on the side of the neck and severe trismus.</li>
<li><strong>Buccal space:</strong> Causes swelling of the cheek.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 16:</h3>
<p>An 8-year-old patient visited the clinic with concerns from parents about a lower second primary molar appearing infraoccluded. Radiographic examination reveals the presence of the succedaneous premolar. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Monitor and observe</strong></li>
<li>B. Extract the primary molar and place a space maintainer</li>
<li>C. Extract the primary molar and extrude the permanent one orthodontically</li>
<li>D. Extract the primary molar and extrude the permanent one surgically</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An infraoccluded primary molar is a sign of <strong>ankylosis</strong>.</li>
<li>The standard management for an ankylosed primary molar with a permanent successor present is to <strong>monitor and observe</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> In the majority of cases, the ankylosed roots will still undergo normal resorption, and the tooth will exfoliate spontaneously at the correct time (or with a slight delay of up to 6-12 months).</li>
<li><strong>Intervention is only required if:</strong><ol>
<li>The infraocclusion becomes severe, causing the adjacent teeth to tip and lose arch length.</li>
<li>The tooth fails to exfoliate long after its expected time, preventing the eruption of the permanent successor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Since the patient is only 8, there is plenty of time for normal exfoliation to occur.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 17:</h3>
<p>Which of the following medical conditions has been shown to have a strong association with obstructive sleep apnea?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Hypertension</strong></li>
<li>B. Insomnia</li>
<li>C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
<li>D. Cardiac arrhythmia</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a recognized cause of secondary <strong>hypertension</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> During apneic episodes at night, the body experiences oxygen desaturation and surges in sympathetic nervous system activity. This repeated nocturnal stress keeps the mean blood pressure elevated. Over time, this leads to sustained hypertension even during the day when breathing is normal.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Insomnia:</strong> Patients with OSA are typically sleepy, not unable to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>COPD:</strong> While a patient can have both OSA and COPD (called overlap syndrome), one does not cause the other. They are separate conditions with different pathologies.</li>
<li><strong>Cardiac arrhythmia:</strong> While severe OSA can contribute to arrhythmias, hypertension is the most direct and strongly established cardiovascular consequence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 18:</h3>
<p>A patient presents with pain and restricted mandibular opening. Clinical examination reveals the following: the patient achieves a mandibular opening of 15 mm, but with mild passive force, an additional 5 mm of opening is achieved. Lateral excursive movements are normal. There are no clicking sounds. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Anterior disc displacement with reduction</li>
<li>B. Anterior disc displacement without reduction</li>
<li><strong>C. Myofascial pain</strong></li>
<li>D. Condylar subluxation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a classic presentation of <strong>myofascial pain</strong> (muscle-related TMD).</li>
<li><strong>Key Differentiator:</strong> The limited opening is due to muscle pain and guarding ("soft end feel"). When the clinician applies gentle passive force (assisted opening), the muscle can be stretched slightly, resulting in a small increase in opening. Lateral movements are typically normal.</li>
<li><strong>Anterior Disc Displacement without Reduction:</strong> This condition involves a mechanical obstruction ("hard end feel"). The disc is stuck in front of the condyle, physically blocking its translation. Assisted opening will <strong>not</strong> increase the range of motion. Additionally, there would be a limited lateral movement to the contralateral side.</li>
<li><strong>Anterior Disc Displacement with Reduction:</strong> This is characterized by a reciprocal click and generally does not have a severely limited opening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 19:</h3>
<p>A 65-year-old patient is scheduled for full-mouth extractions followed by immediate complete denture placement. In preparation for alveoloplasty during the surgical phase, a surgical stent is fabricated. Where is the most appropriate site for positioning the stent to guide bone contouring?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. On the palatal vault only</li>
<li><strong>B. On the alveolar ridge</strong></li>
<li>C. On the occlusal surfaces of the opposing teeth</li>
<li>D. On the buccal and lingual soft tissues adjacent to the ridge</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An immediate denture is fabricated on a cast where the lab technician has already "extracted" the teeth and smoothed the ridge. This lab-created ridge may not perfectly match the patient's ridge immediately after extractions.</li>
<li>A <strong>surgical stent</strong> is a clear, rigid duplicate of the fitting surface of the immediate denture.</li>
<li>Its purpose is to be placed directly <strong>on the alveolar ridge</strong> after the extractions. Any areas where the patient's bone is too high or sharp will cause the clear stent to blanch under pressure. The surgeon then uses this visual guide to perform an alveoloplasty, trimming the bone until the stent seats passively without any blanching. This ensures the final immediate denture will fit comfortably without pressure spots.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 20:</h3>
<p>A 63-year-old patient is suffering from liver cirrhosis. Before a planned extraction of tooth #48, the patient's coagulation mechanisms should be evaluated using which of the following laboratory tests?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Platelet count</li>
<li>B. Bleeding time</li>
<li><strong>C. Prothrombin time (PT)</strong></li>
<li>D. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Liver disease, such as cirrhosis, severely impairs the liver's ability to synthesize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (Factors II, VII, IX, X).</li>
<li>The <strong>Prothrombin Time (PT)</strong> specifically assesses the extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade. It is particularly sensitive to deficiencies in Factor VII, which has the shortest half-life and is the first to be depleted in liver disease.</li>
<li>Therefore, a prolonged PT is the most sensitive and important test to evaluate coagulation function in a patient with liver disease.</li>
<li>The other options test for different things: platelet count (thrombocytopenia), bleeding time (platelet function, now outdated), and ESR (inflammation).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 21:</h3>
<p>Which of the following criteria is/are required for an ideal implant placement in the posterior maxilla?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. The implant should be at least 3 mm from adjacent teeth.</li>
<li>B. The implant should be at least 2 mm from adjacent implants.</li>
<li><strong>C. The implant should be at least 4 mm in diameter.</strong></li>
<li>D. The implant dimension should correspond to the natural tooth dimension at the cementoenamel junction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The posterior maxilla often has poorer quality bone (Type III or IV), so a wider implant is needed to achieve adequate primary stability and bone-to-implant contact for long-term success.</li>
<li><strong>Ideal Dimensions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Diameter:</strong> The minimum recommended diameter for an implant in the posterior maxilla is <strong>4 mm</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Distance to Teeth:</strong> The implant should be at least <strong>1.5 mm</strong> from adjacent natural teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Distance to Implants:</strong> The implant should be at least <strong>3 mm</strong> from an adjacent implant.</li>
<li><strong>Coronal Dimension:</strong> The implant dimension should correspond to the natural tooth dimension approximately <strong>2 mm below the CEJ</strong>, not at the CEJ, to allow for a proper emergence profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 22:</h3>
<p>An anterior open bite of skeletal etiology is characterized by which of the following?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Spacing in the mandible</li>
<li>B. Short lower anterior facial height</li>
<li>C. Shallow mandibular plane angle</li>
<li><strong>D. Class II skeletal relationship</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A skeletal open bite is caused by a vertical growth pattern, where the posterior maxilla and mandible grow downward and backward more than forward.</li>
<li><strong>Key Characteristics of Skeletal Open Bite:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Increased Lower Anterior Facial Height:</strong> The face appears long.</li>
<li><strong>Steep Mandibular Plane Angle:</strong> The mandible is angled steeply downward.</li>
<li><strong>Downward and Backward Rotation of the Mandible:</strong> This backward rotation of the mandible results in the chin being positioned posteriorly, leading to a <strong>Class II skeletal relationship</strong> and mandibular deficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Crowding:</strong> The lack of forward (horizontal) growth often leads to insufficient arch length and crowding in the lower arch, not spacing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 23:</h3>
<p>If a disease has a high incidence but low prevalence, what does this indicate about the disease?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. The disease is short-lived and transient</strong></li>
<li>B. The disease is difficult to treat</li>
<li>C. The disease is chronic</li>
<li>D. The disease is not curable but not fatal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incidence:</strong> The rate of <em>new</em> cases occurring in a population over a specific time.</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> The proportion of a population that <em>has</em> the disease at a specific point in time (new + existing cases).</li>
<li>If many new cases are constantly occurring (high incidence), but the total number of people with the disease at any given time is low (low prevalence), it means people are leaving the "diseased" group very quickly. There are two main ways this can happen:<ol>
<li><strong>Rapid Cure:</strong> The disease is acute and resolves quickly (e.g., the common cold). People get sick and then get better fast.</li>
<li><strong>High Fatality:</strong> The disease is rapidly fatal. People get sick and die quickly, so they are no longer counted in the prevalence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Options B, C, and D all describe conditions that would lead to a <em>high</em> prevalence because the duration of the disease is long.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 24:</h3>
<p>An 80-year-old patient presented to the clinic for vital pulp therapy. Following the application of topical benzocaine, the patient reported having difficulty in swallowing. Which of the following signs and symptoms would require immediate administration of epinephrine?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Pallor of the fingers</li>
<li>B. Confusion or dizziness</li>
<li><strong>C. Hypotension</strong></li>
<li>D. Wheezing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The patient is experiencing an allergic reaction, specifically angioedema (swelling, causing difficulty swallowing). The key is to determine when this reaction has progressed to life-threatening <strong>anaphylaxis</strong>.</li>
<li>Anaphylaxis is diagnosed when there is an allergic reaction plus involvement of either the <strong>respiratory system</strong> or the <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>.</li>
<li>The immediate treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine.</li>
<li><strong>Signs of Anaphylaxis:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Respiratory:</strong> Wheezing, difficulty breathing, laryngeal edema.</li>
<li><strong>Cardiovascular:</strong> <strong>Hypotension</strong> (a sharp drop in blood pressure), tachycardia, shock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hypotension is a clear sign of cardiovascular collapse and mandates the immediate use of epinephrine. Wheezing would also be a correct answer as it indicates severe respiratory distress. Dizziness and pallor are less specific and do not alone define anaphylaxis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 25:</h3>
<p>A patient has a tumor in one of his salivary glands. Histological examination reveals a transition in the epithelial lining of a salivary gland duct from cuboidal ductal epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium. What term best describes this histological finding?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Dysplasia</li>
<li><strong>B. Metaplasia</strong></li>
<li>C. Hyperplasia</li>
<li>D. Choristoma</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metaplasia:</strong> This is a reversible change where one differentiated cell type is replaced by another differentiated cell type. It's often an adaptive response to chronic irritation. In this case, the normal cuboidal epithelium of the duct changed into the more robust stratified squamous epithelium.</li>
<li><strong>Dysplasia:</strong> This refers to disordered growth and maturation of cells. It is a pre-cancerous change, characterized by abnormal cell size, shape, and organization.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperplasia:</strong> An increase in the <em>number</em> of cells.</li>
<li><strong>Choristoma:</strong> Normal tissue found in an abnormal location (e.g., bone tissue in the tongue).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 26:</h3>
<p>Which of the following tissues is responsible for the differentiation of ectomesenchymal cells of the dental papilla into odontoblasts?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Stratum intermedium</li>
<li>B. Stellate reticulum</li>
<li><strong>C. Inner enamel epithelium</strong></li>
<li>D. Outer enamel epithelium</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This process is part of reciprocal induction during tooth development.</li>
<li>The cells of the <strong>inner enamel epithelium (IEE)</strong> differentiate into pre-ameloblasts. As they do, they send signaling molecules to the adjacent ectomesenchymal cells of the dental papilla.</li>
<li>These signals induce the dental papilla cells to differentiate into odontoblasts, which then begin to lay down the first layer of dentin. This dentin, in turn, signals the pre-ameloblasts to fully mature into ameloblasts and begin laying down enamel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 27:</h3>
<p>A patient came to the clinic complaining of pain and swelling in the right temporomandibular joint. A CT scan revealed the presence of a unilateral radiopaque opacity adjacent to the condyle. The condylar head and neck were intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>B. Osteoarthritis</li>
<li>C. Osteosarcoma</li>
<li><strong>D. Synovial chondromatosis</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synovial Chondromatosis:</strong> This is a benign condition where cartilaginous nodules form within the synovial membrane of the joint. These nodules can detach and float freely in the joint space ("joint mice") and may calcify, appearing as multiple small radiopaque bodies on a CT scan. The key feature is that the condyle itself remains intact, unlike in degenerative or malignant diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Rheumatoid/Osteoarthritis:</strong> These are degenerative diseases that would show erosion, flattening, or osteophyte formation on the condylar surface itself.</li>
<li><strong>Osteosarcoma:</strong> This is a highly aggressive malignant tumor that would present as a large, destructive lesion of the bone, not small, distinct opacities with an intact condyle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 28:</h3>
<p>A study investigates the association between smoking and the risk of developing periodontitis. The overall odds ratio is 2.5. After stratifying by vitamin C intake, the odds ratio is 4.0 for individuals with low vitamin C and 1.2 in those with high vitamin C. Which of the following best explains the difference in these findings?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Confounding</li>
<li><strong>B. Effect modification</strong></li>
<li>C. Selection bias</li>
<li>D. Misclassification bias</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effect Modification:</strong> This occurs when the effect of an exposure (smoking) on an outcome (periodontitis) is different at different levels of a third variable (vitamin C intake). The third variable modifies the primary effect. Here, the risk associated with smoking is much higher (OR=4.0) in the low vitamin C group than in the high vitamin C group (OR=1.2). Vitamin C is an effect modifier.</li>
<li><strong>Confounding:</strong> A confounder is a third variable that is associated with <em>both</em> the exposure and the outcome, creating a false association. For example, if coffee drinkers were also more likely to smoke, smoking would be a confounder in a study on coffee and lung cancer. Vitamin C intake is not associated with the act of smoking itself, so it is not a confounder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 29:</h3>
<p>A patient suffered trauma to the lower anterior area that resulted in an alveolar fracture. The fractured segment was repositioned. The cells that will contribute to the healing are mainly derived from the:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Periodontal ligament</li>
<li>B. Cementum</li>
<li>C. Bone marrow</li>
<li><strong>D. Periosteum</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The healing of a bone fracture, including an alveolar fracture, primarily relies on the formation of a callus.</li>
<li>The major source of the osteogenic (bone-forming) cells that create this callus is the <strong>periosteum</strong>, the vascular connective tissue membrane that covers the outer surface of the bone. The inner cambium layer of the periosteum is rich in osteoprogenitor cells that proliferate rapidly after a fracture.</li>
<li>While cells from the bone marrow (endosteum) contribute, the periosteal contribution is considered the most significant for external callus formation and stabilizing the fracture.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 30:</h3>
<p>A patient presented to the clinic for the replacement of missing tooth #11 with an implant-retained prosthesis. The patient's main concern is optimal aesthetics. If a 4 mm diameter implant is to be placed, for optimal aesthetic results, which of the following is true with regards to the apico-coronal implant position?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Placement of the implant 1-2 mm apical to the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor</li>
<li><strong>B. Placement of the implant 3-4 mm apical to the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor</strong></li>
<li>C. Placement of the implant at the same level as the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor</li>
<li>D. Placement of the implant 1-2 mm coronal to the gingival margin of the contralateral central incisor</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to create a gradual, natural-looking transition from the narrow implant platform to the wider dimension of the natural tooth crown at the gumline. This is called the emergence profile.</li>
<li>A maxillary central incisor is about 7-8 mm wide at the gingival margin. An implant is only 4 mm wide.</li>
<li>To allow for this transition to occur smoothly over a sufficient vertical distance, the implant platform must be placed significantly deeper. The ideal vertical distance is <strong>3-4 mm apical</strong> to the planned gingival margin (which is determined by the contralateral tooth).</li>
<li>Placing it too shallow (e.g., 1-2 mm) would result in an abrupt, unaesthetic "shelf" or an overly bulky crown contour at the gumline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 31:</h3>
<p>Which of the following features are typically associated with drug-induced gingival enlargements?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Increased deposition of collagen and reduced collagenase activity</li>
<li>B. Epithelial hyperplasia</li>
<li>C. Increased accumulation of non-collagenous proteins</li>
<li><strong>D. All of the above</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drug-induced gingival enlargement (caused by drugs like phenytoin, cyclosporine, and calcium channel blockers) is a complex process involving multiple tissue changes.</li>
<li>Histologically, it is characterized by:<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Deposition of Collagen:</strong> An overproduction of extracellular matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Collagenase Activity:</strong> A decrease in the enzyme that breaks down collagen, leading to its accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>Epithelial Hyperplasia:</strong> An increase in the number of epithelial cells, leading to thickened epithelium with elongated rete pegs.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Ground Substance:</strong> Accumulation of non-collagenous components like glycosaminoglycans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the listed features are hallmarks of this condition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 32:</h3>
<p>A patient presents to your clinic for the extraction of twenty unrestorable teeth and remaining roots. The patient suffered a cerebrovascular accident a year ago and is taking 150 mg dabigatran twice daily. Choose the correct statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Dabigatran must be discontinued on the day of the surgery.</li>
<li><strong>B. Dabigatran must be discontinued one day before the surgery.</strong></li>
<li>C. Dabigatran must be discontinued five days before the surgery.</li>
<li>D. Dabigatran should not be discontinued.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is a direct thrombin inhibitor, an anticoagulant with a short half-life (around 12-17 hours).</li>
<li><strong>For minor surgical procedures:</strong> The drug is typically not discontinued.</li>
<li><strong>For major or highly invasive procedures:</strong> This includes full-mouth extractions, where significant bleeding is expected. Due to its short half-life, the guidelines recommend discontinuing the drug for a short period. The standard protocol is to stop the medication <strong>one day (24 hours)</strong> before the surgery to allow its effects to wear off, minimizing bleeding risk while also minimizing the risk of a thrombotic event.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 33:</h3>
<p>A 25-year-old patient presented to the clinic with a 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm submucosal mass on the upper lip. Histopathological examination reveals a neoplasm composed of both glandular epithelial and connective tissue elements. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Oral warts (papilloma)</li>
<li>B. Lipoma</li>
<li><strong>C. Pleomorphic adenoma</strong></li>
<li>D. Lymphoepithelial polyp</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pleomorphic Adenoma</strong> (also known as a benign mixed tumor) is the most common salivary gland tumor. It is defined by its "pleomorphic" or mixed appearance, containing both epithelial (ductal) components and myoepithelial components within a mesenchymal (connective tissue-like) background. They commonly present as a slow-growing, firm, submucosal mass, frequently on the palate or upper lip.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Papilloma:</strong> Is a surface lesion, not submucosal, and is purely epithelial.</li>
<li><strong>Lipoma:</strong> Is a benign tumor of fat cells.</li>
<li><strong>Lymphoepithelial polyp:</strong> Is comprised of lymphoid and epithelial tissue, often a counterpart to a branchial cleft cyst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 34:</h3>
<p>Which of the following radiographs is indicated to check the alveolar bone level in order to perform a crown lengthening procedure on an anterior tooth?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Cone beam CT (CBCT)</li>
<li>B. Bitewing radiograph</li>
<li><strong>C. Periapical radiograph</strong></li>
<li>D. Panoramic radiograph</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most critical factor in determining if crown lengthening is feasible is the <strong>crown-to-root ratio</strong>. The surgeon must ensure that after removing bone, enough root structure will remain embedded in bone to support the final restoration (a minimum 1:1 ratio is required <em>after</em> the procedure).</li>
<li>A <strong>periapical (PA) radiograph</strong> is the only standard radiograph that shows the entire tooth, from the crown to the apex of the root. This is essential for assessing the overall root length and the existing crown-to-root ratio.</li>
<li>A bitewing is inappropriate for anterior teeth and only shows the coronal portion of posterior teeth. A panoramic has too much distortion for this precise measurement. A CBCT is overkill and not the initial indicated radiograph for this assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 35:</h3>
<p>A patient came to the clinic for a six-month recall exam after the extraction of upper tooth #16. During the extraction, an oroantral communication developed and was treated. The patient complained of bad breath and bad taste from the socket of #16. The patient also complained of a feeling of fullness and pressure in the middle part of his face. Which of the following antibiotics should be prescribed for this patient's infection?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Penicillin V</li>
<li>B. Azithromycin</li>
<li><strong>C. Amoxicillin and clavulanate</strong></li>
<li>D. Metronidazole</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The patient's symptoms (bad taste/breath from the site, facial pressure) six months after an oroantral communication indicate a <strong>chronic odontogenic maxillary sinusitis</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Microbiology:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Acute</strong> odontogenic sinusitis is typically caused by aerobic, gram-positive streptococci, for which Penicillin V is the drug of choice.</li>
<li><strong>Chronic</strong> sinusitis, however, involves a mixed flora of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many that are beta-lactamase producers (meaning they are resistant to standard penicillin or amoxicillin).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> <strong>Amoxicillin and clavulanate (Augmentin)</strong> is the drug of choice for chronic odontogenic sinusitis. The clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that overcomes the bacterial resistance, making the amoxicillin effective against a broader spectrum of pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 36:</h3>
<p>An 11-year-old patient presented to the clinic with his mother for a routine dental examination. Following radiographic examination, a radiopaque mass with tooth-like structures in the anterior maxilla was observed. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Complex odontoma</li>
<li><strong>B. Compound odontoma</strong></li>
<li>C. Ameloblastic fibro-odontoma</li>
<li>D. Osteoma</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An odontoma is a benign tumor of odontogenic origin. There are two main types:</li>
<li><strong>Compound Odontoma:</strong> Characterized by the formation of multiple small, malformed but identifiable tooth-like structures called "denticles". They are most commonly found in the <strong>anterior maxilla</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Odontoma:</strong> An amorphous, disorganized mass of dental tissues (enamel, dentin, cementum) with no resemblance to teeth. They are most commonly found in the <strong>posterior mandible</strong>.</li>
<li>The description of "tooth-like structures" in the anterior maxilla is the classic presentation of a compound odontoma.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 37:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is the most potent corticosteroid?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Dexamethasone</strong></li>
<li>B. Hydrocortisone</li>
<li>C. Triamcinolone</li>
<li>D. Prednisolone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Corticosteroids are ranked by their relative anti-inflammatory potency, with hydrocortisone often used as the baseline (potency = 1).</li>
<li><strong>Potency Ranking (Least to Most Potent):</strong><ol>
<li>Hydrocortisone (Potency: 1)</li>
<li>Prednisolone (Potency: 4)</li>
<li>Triamcinolone (Potency: 5)</li>
<li><strong>Dexamethasone</strong> / Betamethasone (Potency: 25)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Dexamethasone and Betamethasone are the most potent corticosteroids commonly used. Of the options provided, Dexamethasone is the strongest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 38:</h3>
<p>A patient presents for the extraction of tooth #16. During the procedure, a large piece of bone was associated with the palatal root. Examination of the socket reveals a significant oroantral communication. A buccal advancement flap closure is planned. Which of the following statements regarding the buccal advancement flap is true?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It requires a four-corner flap extending one tooth mesial and one tooth distal.</li>
<li>B. It requires a partial-thickness flap creation.</li>
<li><strong>C. It requires a four-corner flap limited to tooth #16.</strong></li>
<li>D. Healing is primarily by secondary intention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A buccal advancement flap is used to close an oroantral communication by advancing the buccal tissue over the socket.</li>
<li><strong>Flap Design:</strong> This procedure requires a trapezoidal or <strong>four-corner flap</strong>. Critically, the vertical releasing incisions must be <strong>limited to the extraction site</strong> (i.e., at the mesial and distal line angles of the #16 socket). This allows the flap to be advanced and sutured over the socket without overlapping onto the adjacent teeth. Extending it mesially or distally would be incorrect.</li>
<li><strong>Thickness:</strong> It is a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap.</li>
<li><strong>Healing:</strong> It is closed primarily, so healing is by primary intention.</li>
<li>A key step is the horizontal periosteal releasing incision at the base of the flap, which allows it to stretch and advance without tension. The main disadvantage is a reduction in vestibular depth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 39:</h3>
<p>Six weeks after treatment of necrotizing periodontitis, a patient presents for periodontal re-evaluation. Clinical examination reveals resolution of infection, but a persistent interdental crater remains mesial to #13. There is 5 mm of recession at the interdental papilla and 3 mm of buccal gingiva recession on tooth #13. Based on these findings, which of the following best describes the recession classification?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. RT1</li>
<li>B. RT2</li>
<li><strong>C. RT3</strong></li>
<li>D. Not classifiable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Miller recession classification has been updated to the RT (Recession Type) classification system, which is based on the relationship between facial and interproximal attachment loss.</li>
<li><strong>RT1:</strong> Gingival recession with no loss of interproximal attachment.</li>
<li><strong>RT2:</strong> Gingival recession where the amount of interproximal attachment loss is <em>less than or equal to</em> the buccal attachment loss.</li>
<li><strong>RT3:</strong> Gingival recession where the amount of interproximal attachment loss is <em>greater than</em> the buccal attachment loss.</li>
<li>In this case, the interproximal recession (5 mm) is greater than the buccal recession (3 mm), which defines it as <strong>RT3</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 40:</h3>
<p>A patient presents with a complaint of clicking in the temporomandibular joint upon opening. The patient mentioned that he suffered from frequent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint, and upon clinical examination, the patient was found to have a mouth opening of 45 mm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of the patient's chief complaint?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Anterior disc displacement with reduction</strong></li>
<li>B. Anterior disc displacement without reduction</li>
<li>C. Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome</li>
<li>D. Temporomandibular joint dislocation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patient's Chief Complaint:</strong> The primary complaint is the <strong>clicking</strong> sound.</li>
<li><strong>Clicking:</strong> A click upon opening and closing is the hallmark sign of <strong>Anterior Disc Displacement with Reduction (ADDwR)</strong>. This sound is the condyle moving over the posterior band of the displaced disc during opening (the "reduction") and slipping back off during closing.</li>
<li><strong>Associated Findings:</strong> A history of hypermobility and frequent dislocation (subluxation) can lead to the ligaments becoming stretched, which predisposes the patient to disc displacement. The wide mouth opening (45 mm) is also consistent with hypermobility and rules out ADD <em>without</em> reduction, which would cause a severely limited opening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 41:</h3>
<p>Which of the following pharyngeal arches are affected by Treacher Collins syndrome?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. First alone</li>
<li>B. Third alone</li>
<li><strong>C. First and second</strong></li>
<li>D. Second and third</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treacher Collins syndrome (also known as mandibulofacial dysostosis) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.</li>
<li>It is characterized by developmental defects in the structures that arise from the <strong>first and second pharyngeal (or branchial) arches</strong>.</li>
<li>This results in characteristic craniofacial deformities, including underdeveloped zygomatic bones (cheekbones), a very small mandible (micrognathia), malformed external ears, and down-slanting eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 42:</h3>
<p>Vertical root fractures are usually directed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Mesiodistally</li>
<li><strong>B. Buccolingually</strong></li>
<li>C. Mesiobuccally and distobuccally</li>
<li>D. Mesiolingually and distolingually</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The orientation of fractures depends on the forces applied and the anatomy of the tooth.</li>
<li><strong>Vertical Root Fractures (VRF):</strong> These are most common in endodontically treated teeth, often caused by the wedging forces from posts or over-condensation of gutta-percha. These forces typically split the root in a <strong>buccolingual</strong> or faciolingual direction.</li>
<li><strong>Cracked Tooth/Split Tooth:</strong> Fractures that originate in the crown and propagate apically (often in vital teeth) are typically oriented <strong>mesiodistally</strong>, running through the marginal ridges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 43:</h3>
<p>A child is brought to the clinic with a maculopapular rash on the face and neck. The mother reports that two days earlier, the child had small erythematous macules with a white necrotic center on the buccal mucosa. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Rubeola (Measles)</strong></li>
<li>B. Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis</li>
<li>C. Varicella (Chickenpox)</li>
<li>D. Primary syphilis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "small erythematous macules with a white necrotic center on the buccal mucosa" is a perfect description of <strong>Koplik's spots</strong>.</li>
<li>Koplik's spots are pathognomonic for <strong>Rubeola (measles)</strong>. They appear on the buccal mucosa 1-2 days <em>before</em> the onset of the characteristic maculopapular skin rash that starts on the face and spreads downwards.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 44:</h3>
<p>Which of the following ganglia is the most common site for the latency of herpes zoster infection?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Trigeminal ganglion</li>
<li><strong>B. Dorsal root ganglion</strong></li>
<li>C. Geniculate ganglion</li>
<li>D. Otic ganglion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Herpes zoster (shingles) is caused by the reactivation of the Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox.</li>
<li>After the primary chickenpox infection, the virus travels up sensory nerves and establishes latency primarily in the <strong>dorsal root ganglia</strong> of the spinal cord.</li>
<li>This is why the shingles rash most commonly appears in a dermatomal pattern on the trunk (back, chest, abdomen).</li>
<li>While VZV <em>can</em> become latent in the trigeminal ganglion (leading to facial shingles), the dorsal root ganglia of the spine are the most common site overall. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is the virus that characteristically establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 45:</h3>
<p>A study investigates the association between a specific dental hygiene practice and the development of gum disease. The results show an odds ratio of 0.2 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.1 to 0.3. What do these findings indicate?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Strong evidence that the dental hygiene practice leads to gum disease.</li>
<li><strong>B. Strong evidence that the dental hygiene practice is effective in preventing gum disease.</strong></li>
<li>C. Weak evidence that the dental hygiene practice leads to gum disease.</li>
<li>D. Weak evidence that the dental hygiene practice is effective in preventing gum disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpreting the Odds Ratio (OR):</strong><ul>
<li>An OR of 1.0 means no association.</li>
<li>An OR &gt; 1.0 means the exposure increases the risk of the outcome.</li>
<li>An OR &lt; 1.0 means the exposure is protective against the outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In this case, the OR is 0.2, which is significantly less than 1.0, indicating a <strong>protective effect</strong>. The dental practice helps prevent gum disease.</li>
<li><strong>Assessing the Strength:</strong> The strength of the evidence is determined by how far the OR is from 1.0. An OR of 0.2 is very far from 1.0 (an 80% reduction in odds), indicating a <strong>strong</strong> effect. An OR of 0.9, for example, would be a weak effect.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence Interval (CI):</strong> The 95% CI is (0.1 to 0.3). Since this range does not include 1.0, the result is statistically significant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 46:</h3>
<p>Increasing the filler content of a composite resin will result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Decreased wear resistance and increased polymerization shrinkage</li>
<li>B. Increased wear resistance and increased polymerization shrinkage</li>
<li>C. Decreased wear resistance and decreased polymerization shrinkage</li>
<li><strong>D. Increased wear resistance and decreased polymerization shrinkage</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The filler particles (e.g., glass, silica) are the hard, inert component of composite resin, while the resin matrix is the softer, polymerizable component.</li>
<li><strong>Effect on Wear Resistance:</strong> Increasing the amount of hard filler particles makes the material stronger and more resistant to abrasion and wear. Therefore, wear resistance <strong>increases</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Effect on Polymerization Shrinkage:</strong> Polymerization shrinkage occurs when the resin matrix monomers link together. The filler particles do not shrink. By increasing the filler content, you decrease the relative volume of resin matrix that is available to shrink. Therefore, overall polymerization shrinkage <strong>decreases</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 47:</h3>
<p>During the extraction of a partially impacted third molar, while sectioning the roots, a complete transection of the lingual nerve occurred. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Nerve mapping for three months followed by microsurgical repair if no improvement</li>
<li><strong>B. Immediate microsurgical repair with a 7-0 epineural suture</strong></li>
<li>C. Inform the patient that this is a common complication and recovery without treatment is expected</li>
<li>D. Prescribe a course of high-dose corticosteroids</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When a nerve is known to be completely transected (cut) and is visualized during surgery, the best prognosis is achieved with <strong>immediate primary repair</strong>.</li>
<li>The procedure involves carefully realigning the two severed ends of the nerve and suturing the outer layer (the epineurium) together with very fine sutures under magnification (microsurgery).</li>
<li>Waiting is not appropriate because the nerve ends will retract and form a traumatic neuroma, making a delayed repair much more difficult and less successful. Nerve mapping is for cases where the injury is unobserved and needs to be diagnosed post-operatively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 48:</h3>
<p>Which of the following statements best describes the use of a high-sensitivity test?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It confirms a disease diagnosis.</li>
<li>B. It predicts prognosis accurately.</li>
<li>C. It rules in disease when the test is positive.</li>
<li><strong>D. It rules out disease when the test is negative.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This question relates to the concepts of sensitivity and specificity, often remembered by the mnemonic <strong>SNout</strong> and <strong>SPin</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>SNout:</strong> A test with high <strong>S</strong>e<strong>n</strong>sitivity, when <strong>N</strong>egative, helps to rule <strong>out</strong> the disease. A highly sensitive test has very few false negatives. Therefore, if a patient tests negative with a highly sensitive test, you can be very confident they do not have the disease. It is a good screening test.</li>
<li><strong>SPin:</strong> A test with high <strong>Sp</strong>ecificity, when <strong>P</strong>ositive, helps to rule <strong>in</strong> the disease. A highly specific test has very few false positives. Therefore, if a patient tests positive with a highly specific test, you can be very confident they do have the disease. It is a good confirmatory test.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 49:</h3>
<p>During fixed appliance therapy, an orthodontic bracket is inadvertently positioned too far mesially to the long axis of tooth #14 (maxillary right first premolar). In which direction is this tooth most likely to be displaced during leveling and alignment?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Distolingual rotation</li>
<li><strong>B. Distobuccal rotation</strong></li>
<li>C. Mesial tipping</li>
<li>D. Extrusion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When a bracket is misplaced, the archwire will try to move the tooth to a position where the bracket <em>would be</em> centered. The tooth moves in the opposite direction of the bracket misplacement to align the bracket slot with the wire.</li>
<li>If the bracket is placed too <strong>mesially</strong>, the wire will exert a force that causes the tooth to rotate <strong>distally</strong>.</li>
<li>The rotation is described from the facial surface where the force is applied. Therefore, the mesial side of the buccal surface will move palatally, and the distal side of the buccal surface will move buccally. This movement is called a <strong>distobuccal rotation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 50:</h3>
<p>A 17-year-old male presents with pain and swelling in the right lower jaw. Clinical examination reveals a large MOD restoration on tooth #46. The tooth responds positively to vitality testing. Radiographic examination shows a well-defined radiopaque mass fused to the roots of tooth #46, surrounded by a thin radiolucent rim. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Hypercementosis</li>
<li><strong>B. Cementoblastoma</strong></li>
<li>C. Condensing osteitis</li>
<li>D. Periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a classic presentation of a <strong>cementoblastoma</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features of Cementoblastoma:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Vital Tooth:</strong> It occurs in association with a vital tooth.</li>
<li><strong>Pain and Swelling:</strong> It is a true neoplasm and often causes pain and expansion of the cortical plates.</li>
<li><strong>Radiographic Appearance:</strong> It appears as a well-defined radiopaque mass that is <strong>fused to the root</strong> of the tooth, obscuring the root outline. It is characteristically surrounded by a thin, uniform radiolucent rim.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Hypercementosis:</strong> Does not cause pain or swelling.</li>
<li><strong>Condensing osteitis:</strong> Is a reaction to a <em>necrotic</em> pulp.</li>
<li><strong>Periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia:</strong> Is not fused to the root (the PDL space is intact) and does not typically cause pain or swelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 51:</h3>
<p>A patient presented with a lower third molar that is partially impacted and has an operculum that is leading to entrapment of food. Although no history of pericoronitis was reported, what would be the most suitable approach for the prevention of pericoronitis in this patient?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Operculectomy</li>
<li>B. Glass ionomer cement sealant</li>
<li>C. Composite resin restoration</li>
<li><strong>D. Extraction of the lower third molar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The definitive and most effective way to prevent pericoronitis is to eliminate the environment that causes it. This means removing the partially impacted tooth.</li>
<li><strong>Extraction</strong> is the primary prevention method.</li>
<li><strong>Operculectomy</strong> (removing the overlying soft tissue flap) is considered an incomplete and often temporary solution. The soft tissue frequently grows back, leading to a recurrence of the problem. Restorations like sealants or fillings do not address the impaction or the soft tissue operculum.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 52:</h3>
<p>What is the recommended management for a five-year-old child who snacks three times a day?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Toothbrushing twice a day with a rice-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.</li>
<li><strong>B. Toothbrushing twice a day with a pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.</strong></li>
<li>C. Toothbrushing after each snack with a rice-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.</li>
<li>D. Toothbrushing after each snack with a pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This question tests the standard guidelines for fluoride toothpaste use in children. The key factors are the child's age and the amount of toothpaste.</li>
<li><strong>Age-Based Guidelines:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Under 3 years:</strong> Use a minimal amount (a "smear" or the size of a grain of rice).</li>
<li><strong>3 to 6 years:</strong> Use a <strong>pea-sized</strong> amount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The child is five years old, so a pea-sized amount is appropriate. Brushing twice a day is the standard recommendation; brushing after every single snack is generally not considered practical or necessary if twice-daily brushing is effective.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 53:</h3>
<p>A nine-year-old patient has atrial fibrillation and a prosthetic cardiac device that was placed nine months ago. The patient is scheduled for an extraction of a primary molar. Which of the following medications is the most appropriate prophylactic antibiotic for this patient?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Amoxicillin</li>
<li>B. Clindamycin</li>
<li>C. Azithromycin</li>
<li><strong>D. No antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The key is to identify the type of "prosthetic cardiac device." A patient with atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disorder) would most likely have a <strong>pacemaker</strong> or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).</li>
<li>According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, pacemakers and ICDs are <strong>not</strong> conditions that require antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.</li>
<li>Antibiotic prophylaxis is only required for a small list of high-risk conditions, such as prosthetic heart valves, a history of infective endocarditis, specific congenital heart defects, and cardiac transplant recipients who develop valvulopathy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 54:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is/are seen in patients with left-sided heart failure?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Generalized fatigue</li>
<li><strong>B. Dyspnea</strong></li>
<li>C. Pitting edema</li>
<li>D. Distended jugular veins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Heart failure is divided into left-sided and right-sided, each with distinct symptoms based on where blood is backing up.</li>
<li><strong>Left-Sided Heart Failure:</strong> The left ventricle fails to pump blood effectively to the body. Blood backs up from the left ventricle into the left atrium, and then into the <strong>pulmonary circulation (the lungs)</strong>. This leads to pulmonary congestion and edema. The hallmark symptom is <strong>dyspnea</strong> (shortness of breath), especially orthopnea (dyspnea when lying flat) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.</li>
<li><strong>Right-Sided Heart Failure:</strong> The right ventricle fails, and blood backs up into the <strong>systemic venous circulation</strong>. This causes peripheral signs like <strong>pitting edema</strong> (in the legs and ankles) and <strong>distended jugular veins</strong>. Fatigue is common in both but is a more general symptom.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 55:</h3>
<p>Nitroglycerin is used to treat coronary disease by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Peripheral arterial dilation and increased preload</li>
<li>B. Peripheral arterial dilation and decreased preload</li>
<li><strong>C. Peripheral venous dilation and decreased preload</strong></li>
<li>D. Peripheral venous dilation and increased preload</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator used to relieve angina pectoris.</li>
<li>Its primary mechanism of action is <strong>venous dilation</strong> (veno-dilation). By dilating the peripheral veins, it causes blood to pool in the periphery and reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart.</li>
<li>This reduction in venous return is known as a <strong>decrease in preload</strong>.</li>
<li>By decreasing the preload, the heart has to work less to pump blood, which reduces the oxygen demand of the cardiac muscle and alleviates the ischemic pain of angina.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 56:</h3>
<p>A 19-year-old female with a history of easy bruising and frequent nosebleeds is diagnosed with von Willebrand disease. Which of the following tests is most likely to be abnormal?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Prothrombin time (PT)</li>
<li><strong>B. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)</strong></li>
<li>C. Platelet count</li>
<li>D. Thrombin time (TT)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Von Willebrand Disease (vWD) is a disorder of both primary and secondary hemostasis.</li>
<li><strong>Von Willebrand Factor (vWF)</strong> has two main functions:<ol>
<li>It facilitates platelet adhesion to injured blood vessels (primary hemostasis).</li>
<li>It acts as a carrier protein for <strong>Factor VIII</strong>, protecting it from rapid degradation in the circulation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Because a deficiency in vWF leads to a functional deficiency of Factor VIII, the <strong>intrinsic pathway</strong> of the coagulation cascade is affected.</li>
<li>The <strong>APTT</strong> is the test that screens the intrinsic pathway, so it will be prolonged or abnormal in patients with vWD. The Platelet Function Assay (PFA) would also be abnormal, but of the options given, APTT is correct. Platelet count is usually normal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 57:</h3>
<p>An anxious elderly patient presented to the clinic for the extraction of an isolated tooth #37. Following the evaluation of the patient's condition, it was deemed best to perform the procedure under minimal sedation. Which of the following is the most appropriate to sedate the patient if the procedure was going to last for 30 minutes?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. 0.125 mg of Triazolam</strong></li>
<li>B. 0.25 mg of Triazolam</li>
<li>C. 10 mg of Diazepam</li>
<li>D. 15 mg of Lorazepam</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This question tests the knowledge of appropriate oral sedatives and their doses for minimal sedation in adults.</li>
<li><strong>Triazolam (Halcion)</strong> is an excellent choice for short procedures (&lt; 2 hours) due to its rapid onset and short half-life.</li>
<li>For minimal sedation for a short appointment, the recommended adult dose of Triazolam is <strong>0.125 mg to 0.25 mg</strong>. Since 0.125 mg is an option and is the lower end of the minimal sedation range, it is the most appropriate starting dose, especially for an elderly patient.</li>
<li>Diazepam and Lorazepam have longer durations of action and are more suitable for longer appointments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 58:</h3>
<p>A 90-year-old uncooperative patient residing in a long-term care facility presents with generalized gingival recession and multiple active cervical carious lesions. What is the most appropriate management approach for this patient?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Topical fluoride application</li>
<li>B. Restore the carious lesions with glass ionomer</li>
<li>C. Application of pit and fissure sealants</li>
<li><strong>D. Application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This clinical scenario is the ideal indication for <strong>Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF)</strong>.</li>
<li>SDF is a liquid that is painted onto carious lesions to arrest their progression. It is highly effective and has several advantages that make it perfect for this patient:<ol>
<li><strong>Non-invasive:</strong> No drilling or anesthesia is required.</li>
<li><strong>Quick and Easy Application:</strong> Essential for an uncooperative patient.</li>
<li><strong>Caries Arrest:</strong> It effectively stops the decay process.</li>
<li><strong>Ideal for Difficult-to-Treat Patients:</strong> Perfect for elderly patients, those with cognitive or physical limitations, and those in long-term care settings.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Restoring with glass ionomer would be too difficult on an uncooperative patient. Topical fluoride is for prevention, not arresting active lesions. Sealants are for pits and fissures, not cervical lesions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 59:</h3>
<p>A patient was given an oral benzodiazepine for conscious sedation. During the procedure, the patient suddenly stopped responding to verbal and tactile stimuli following the termination of the procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Administer flumazenil</li>
<li>B. Provide rescue breaths</li>
<li>C. Place the patient in a Trendelenburg position</li>
<li><strong>D. Check the patient's blood pressure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This question asks for the immediate <strong>next step</strong> in a sequence of emergency management. The patient has become unconscious, which is a sign of overdose/oversedation.</li>
<li>The first priority in any emergency is to assess the patient's status using the <strong>A-B-C</strong>s (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).</li>
<li><strong>A - Airway:</strong> Ensure the airway is patent (e.g., head-tilt, chin-lift).</li>
<li><strong>B - Breathing:</strong> Assess for spontaneous breathing.</li>
<li><strong>C - Circulation:</strong> <strong>Check vital signs</strong>, including pulse and <strong>blood pressure</strong>.</li>
<li>Before administering any reversal agent (like flumazenil) or starting definitive treatment (like rescue breaths), you must first assess the patient's physiological state. Checking vital signs is a critical part of this initial assessment to determine the severity of the depression. Placing the patient in a Trendelenburg position is contraindicated as it can impede breathing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 60:</h3>
<p>Which of the following arteries runs anterior to the masseter muscle?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Transverse facial artery</li>
<li><strong>B. Facial artery</strong></li>
<li>C. Maxillary artery</li>
<li>D. Superficial temporal artery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>facial artery</strong> branches from the external carotid artery, loops under the inferior border of the mandible, and then courses superiorly and anteriorly across the face.</li>
<li>A key anatomical landmark is that it crosses the mandible just <strong>anterior to the insertion of the masseter muscle</strong>. This is where its pulse can be palpated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 61:</h3>
<p>An 11-year-old child fell off her bicycle, striking her chin on the pavement. She presents five days later with severe trismus, a maximum interincisal opening of 5 mm, and hearing difficulty. Clinical examination shows a significant overjet of 15 mm and a posterior unilateral right open bite. Manual palpation and radiographic examination rule out fractures of the maxilla, orbit, and mandible. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Unilateral left subcondylar fracture of the mandible</li>
<li><strong>B. Superior displacement of the left condyle into the middle cranial fossa</strong></li>
<li>C. Superior displacement of the left condyle into the middle ear</li>
<li>D. Fracture of the bones of the left zygomatic arch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A severe upward blow to the chin can, in rare cases, force the mandibular condyle superiorly through the thin roof of the glenoid fossa.</li>
<li>The bone directly superior to the condyle is the floor of the <strong>middle cranial fossa</strong>.</li>
<li>This type of injury, though rare, explains all the symptoms:<ul>
<li><strong>Severe Trismus &amp; Open Bite:</strong> The condyle is physically locked in the cranial base, preventing mandibular movement.</li>
<li><strong>Large Overjet:</strong> The mandible is pushed backward and locked in a retruded position.</li>
<li><strong>Hearing Difficulty:</strong> The proximity to the ear structures can cause auditory symptoms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question explicitly rules out fractures, making this intracranial displacement the most plausible diagnosis. The condyle cannot enter the middle ear, which is positioned medially.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 62:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is NOT considered when assessing the grade of periodontitis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Smoking status</li>
<li>B. Radiographic bone loss progression</li>
<li><strong>C. Number of missing teeth due to periodontitis</strong></li>
<li>D. HbA1c levels in diabetic patients</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The 2017 AAP classification of periodontal diseases includes Staging and Grading.</li>
<li><strong>Staging</strong> assesses the <em>severity and extent</em> of the disease that is already present. This includes factors like clinical attachment loss, radiographic bone loss, and <strong>tooth loss due to periodontitis</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Grading</strong> assesses the <em>rate of progression</em> and future risk of the disease. This is where risk factors are considered. Grade modifiers include:<ul>
<li>Direct evidence (progression over time).</li>
<li>Indirect evidence (% bone loss / age).</li>
<li>Risk factors like <strong>smoking</strong> and glycemic control (<strong>HbA1c</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of missing teeth is a factor for determining the Stage (e.g., Stage III or IV), not the Grade.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 63:</h3>
<p>A 30-year-old patient presents with a complaint of a sore mouth lesion. Clinical examination reveals erythema on the labial attached gingiva, and tangential pressure on the gingiva tests negative for Nikolsky's sign. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Pemphigus vulgaris</li>
<li><strong>B. Mucous membrane pemphigoid</strong></li>
<li>C. Recurrent herpes simplex</li>
<li>D. Aphthous ulcers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Erythema on the attached gingiva</strong> is the description of <strong>desquamative gingivitis</strong>, which is a clinical sign, not a final diagnosis. It is most commonly associated with vesiculobullous diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Nikolsky's Sign:</strong> This is when gentle pressure on clinically normal-appearing mucosa causes the formation of a blister.<ul>
<li><strong>Pemphigus Vulgaris:</strong> The Nikolsky sign is <strong>always positive</strong> because the intraepithelial split is very fragile.</li>
<li><strong>Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid (Cicatricial Pemphigoid):</strong> The Nikolsky sign is often <strong>negative</strong> (but can sometimes be positive). The subepithelial split is tougher and less likely to separate with gentle pressure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since the Nikolsky sign is negative, mucous membrane pemphigoid is the most likely diagnosis. Herpes and aphthous ulcers do not present as desquamative gingivitis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 64:</h3>
<p>A patient presents with irreversible pulpitis in tooth #17, which is clinically and radiographically assessed as unrestorable. Despite being advised to undergo extraction, the patient insists on root canal treatment. If the dentist agrees to proceed with the treatment against their better clinical judgment, which ethical principle is most directly violated?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Autonomy</li>
<li><strong>B. Beneficence</strong></li>
<li>C. Non-maleficence</li>
<li>D. Veracity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> This principle requires the dentist to act in the best interest of the patient and to promote their welfare. Performing a root canal on an unrestorable tooth is not in the patient's best interest; it provides no long-term benefit and is destined to fail.</li>
<li><strong>Non-maleficence ("Do no harm"):</strong> One could argue this is violated, but the more specific violation is failing to do good (beneficence).</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> This is the patient's right to choose their treatment. The dentist is respecting the patient's autonomy but at the expense of their professional duty to provide beneficial care.</li>
<li><strong>Veracity:</strong> This is truthfulness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 65:</h3>
<p>A 40-year-old patient reports a history of pain and discomfort from the upper left molar but is now asymptomatic. Clinical examination reveals a large defective restoration on tooth #26. Radiographic examination revealed a periapical radiolucency at the apex of tooth #26 associated with the mesiobuccal root. Diagnostic testing shows no response to cold or percussion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of tooth #26?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Reversible pulpitis and normal apical tissues</li>
<li>B. Irreversible pulpitis and symptomatic apical periodontitis</li>
<li><strong>C. Pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis</strong></li>
<li>D. Previously treated and asymptomatic apical periodontitis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pulpal Diagnosis:</strong> The tooth shows <strong>no response to cold testing</strong>, which indicates the pulp is non-vital or <strong>necrotic</strong>. The history of pain that is now gone is also consistent with the pulp having died.</li>
<li><strong>Apical Diagnosis:</strong> There is a <strong>periapical radiolucency</strong> on the radiograph, indicating inflammation/infection in the periapical tissues. The tooth shows <strong>no response to percussion</strong>, meaning the inflammation is not currently causing acute pain. This defines the condition as <strong>asymptomatic apical periodontitis</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 66:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is the direct effect of a Humphrey's appliance?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Distalization of second molars</li>
<li>B. Bilateral palatal expansion</li>
<li>C. Unilateral palatal expansion</li>
<li><strong>D. Correction of an ectopically erupting first permanent molar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Humphrey's appliance</strong> (and its modern version, the Halterman appliance) is a specific fixed appliance used to treat an <strong>ectopically erupting first permanent molar</strong>.</li>
<li>This occurs when the maxillary first permanent molar gets caught under the distal bulge of the second primary molar and cannot erupt properly.</li>
<li>The appliance uses a wire with a spring or loop that is activated and placed into the occlusal surface of the impacted first molar. The force from the spring pushes the first molar distally, disengaging it and allowing it to erupt into its proper position.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 67:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is an immediate compensatory mechanism for a circulatory shock?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Hypertension</li>
<li><strong>B. Vasoconstriction</strong></li>
<li>C. Inadequate tissue perfusion</li>
<li>D. Decreased cardiac output</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Circulatory shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion, typically caused by hypotension (low blood pressure) and/or decreased cardiac output.</li>
<li>The body's immediate response to try and compensate for this is to trigger a massive sympathetic nervous system response.</li>
<li>This response causes widespread <strong>vasoconstriction</strong> of peripheral blood vessels. The goal of this vasoconstriction is to shunt blood away from non-essential areas (like skin and extremities) and redirect it to the vital core organs (brain, heart, kidneys) to maintain their perfusion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 68:</h3>
<p>Which of the following muscles will distract the zygomatic arch upon fracture?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Temporalis</li>
<li>B. Medial pterygoid</li>
<li>C. Lateral pterygoid</li>
<li><strong>D. Masseter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Distraction" refers to the pulling apart of the fractured bone segments by muscle forces. This is caused by the muscles that attach directly to the fractured bone.</li>
<li>The <strong>masseter muscle</strong> has a broad origin on the inferior border of the zygomatic arch. When the arch is fractured, the powerful downward and forward pull of the masseter will distract (displace) the fractured segment.</li>
<li>The temporalis muscle passes <em>underneath</em> the zygomatic arch. A depressed fracture of the arch can impinge on the temporalis, causing trismus, but the temporalis does not attach to the arch and therefore does not distract it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 69:</h3>
<p>Which of the following statements best describes the reciprocal arm of a clasp?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. It should be positioned on a surface of the tooth which is parallel to the path of insertion of the denture.</strong></li>
<li>B. The reciprocal arm of the clasp should be tapered.</li>
<li>C. It must be located below the height of contour.</li>
<li>D. It should be flexible to engage an undercut.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The reciprocal arm is a rigid component of a clasp assembly. Its primary function is to brace the abutment tooth against the forces exerted by the flexible retentive arm as it passes over the height of contour during insertion and removal.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features of the Reciprocal Arm:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Rigid:</strong> It must be rigid and not flexible. It is not tapered.</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> It is located on the surface opposite the retentive arm, <strong>at or occlusal to the height of contour</strong> (in the suprabulge area).</li>
<li><strong>Guiding Plane:</strong> It contacts the tooth along a guiding plane, which is a prepared surface that is <strong>parallel to the path of insertion</strong>. This ensures the denture moves smoothly into place without torquing the tooth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 70:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is the hallmark of malignancy?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Refusal to evade immune cells</li>
<li>B. Inducing apoptosis</li>
<li><strong>C. Inducing angiogenesis</strong></li>
<li>D. Genomic stability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "Hallmarks of Cancer" are a set of biological capabilities acquired by cells during the development of human tumors.</li>
<li>One of the critical hallmarks is the ability to <strong>induce angiogenesis</strong>. A tumor cannot grow beyond a very small size (1-2 mm) without developing its own blood supply to provide oxygen and nutrients. Malignant cells secrete signaling molecules (like VEGF) that stimulate the growth of new blood vessels into the tumor.</li>
<li>The other options are the opposite of what malignant cells do: they <em>evade</em> the immune system, <em>evade</em> apoptosis (programmed cell death), and are characterized by genomic <em>instability</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 71:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is the most appropriate material for obturating the root canal system of a primary tooth after a pulpectomy procedure?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. MTA</li>
<li>B. Gutta-percha</li>
<li>C. Zinc oxide eugenol with formocresol</li>
<li><strong>D. Calcium hydroxide with iodoform paste</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The key requirement for a pulpectomy filling material in a primary tooth is that it must be <strong>resorbable</strong>. It needs to resorb at the same rate as the primary tooth's root so it doesn't interfere with the eruption of the permanent successor.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Materials:</strong><ul>
<li>Non-reinforced Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE)</li>
<li>Iodoform-based pastes (like Vitapex or Kri paste)</li>
<li>A combination of <strong>Calcium Hydroxide and Iodoform</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inappropriate Materials:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Gutta-percha and MTA</strong> are non-resorbable and are used for permanent teeth only.</li>
<li><strong>Formocresol</strong> is a fixative used for pulpotomies, not a filling material for pulpectomies, and its use is controversial due to toxicity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 72:</h3>
<p>A dentulous 21-year-old patient presents with a recent extraction of tooth #27 and is seeking a prosthetic replacement. Which type of articulator and occlusal record is most appropriate for the accurate fabrication of a prosthesis to replace tooth #27?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Hand articulation on a non-adjustable articulator</strong></li>
<li>B. Semi-adjustable articulator with centric relation records</li>
<li>C. Fully adjustable articulator with a facebow transfer</li>
<li>D. Arbitrary remounting using average values without occlusal records</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a case of replacing a single posterior tooth in an otherwise intact dentition.</li>
<li>The patient's remaining teeth provide a stable, repeatable maximum intercuspation (MIP). The guidance for all jaw movements is dictated by the remaining natural teeth and the TMJs.</li>
<li>For a single crown or a small fixed bridge in a dentate patient, the casts can simply be <strong>hand-articulated</strong> into MIP. No complex occlusal records are needed.</li>
<li>A simple, <strong>non-adjustable hinge articulator</strong> is sufficient to fabricate the prosthesis, as excursive movements do not need to be replicated for a single posterior tooth. Semi-adjustable and fully adjustable articulators are for complex cases like full-mouth reconstructions or complete dentures where the occlusal scheme must be entirely rebuilt.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 73:</h3>
<p>During surveying for a lower removable partial denture, you identify that the height of contour is too close to the free gingival margin, making clasp placement difficult. What is the most appropriate management strategy?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Use a more flexible clasp arm.</li>
<li><strong>B. Adjust the tilt of the cast on the surveyor.</strong></li>
<li>C. Prepare the undercut with a bur.</li>
<li>D. Place composite resin to create a new height of contour.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first step in resolving any issue with undercuts or heights of contour during surveying is to attempt to solve it by <strong>adjusting the tilt of the cast</strong>.</li>
<li>The position of the height of contour is relative to the vertical path of insertion. By tilting the cast anteriorly, posteriorly, or laterally, you can often change the survey lines to find a more favorable path of insertion that places the height of contour in a more ideal position, allowing for proper clasp placement without resorting to tooth modification.</li>
<li>Only after it's determined that no acceptable tilt can be found should the dentist move on to irreversible procedures like preparing an undercut with a bur (enameloplasty) or adding composite.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 74:</h3>
<p>For squamous cell carcinoma that is found on the lateral border of the tongue, if metastasis occurs, which of the following lymph node groups poses the highest risk of involvement?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Submental nodes</li>
<li>B. Submandibular nodes</li>
<li><strong>C. Jugulodigastric nodes</strong></li>
<li>D. Retropharyngeal nodes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The lymphatic drainage of the tongue is complex, but there are established patterns. The tongue is a very mobile and vascular organ, leading to a high frequency of metastasis to cervical lymph nodes.</li>
<li>While anterior portions can drain to submental and submandibular nodes, the primary drainage pathway for the mobile tongue (including the lateral borders) is to the deep cervical nodes.</li>
<li>The <strong>jugulodigastric nodes</strong>, located in the upper deep cervical chain (Level II), are the most common site for initial metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 75:</h3>
<p>A 58-year-old male smoker presents with a thick, non-scrapable white patch on the lateral border of the tongue. The lesion has persisted for six months without change. There are no symptoms, and an incisional biopsy reveals moderate epithelial dysplasia. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Observe with periodic reassessment</li>
<li><strong>B. Excisional biopsy</strong></li>
<li>C. Prescription of antifungals</li>
<li>D. Refer for radiotherapy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> This is a leukoplakia with moderate dysplasia. Leukoplakia is a clinical term for a white patch, and the biopsy result provides the definitive diagnosis and dictates treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Management Based on Dysplasia Level:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mild Dysplasia:</strong> Can be either monitored closely or excised, depending on clinical factors.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate or Severe Dysplasia:</strong> These are considered high-risk pre-malignant lesions. The standard of care is complete <strong>surgical excision</strong> (an excisional biopsy) to remove the entire lesion and prevent its potential transformation into squamous cell carcinoma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Observation is not sufficient for moderate dysplasia. Antifungals are for candidiasis. Radiotherapy is for treating invasive cancer, not dysplasia.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 76:</h3>
<p>A patient with a history of angina presents to the dental clinic for root canal treatment. During the procedure, the patient experiences an anginal attack. A single sublingual nitroglycerin dose is administered, but the patient's condition does not improve. What should be the subsequent step in the management of this emergency?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Administer a single dose of aspirin</li>
<li>B. Call for emergency medical services</li>
<li>C. Administer 100% oxygen</li>
<li><strong>D. Administer another dose of nitroglycerin</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This question tests the protocol for managing an acute anginal attack.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Protocol:</strong><ol>
<li>Stop the dental procedure.</li>
<li>Administer one dose of sublingual nitroglycerin.</li>
<li>Wait 5 minutes.</li>
<li>If pain persists, <strong>administer a second dose of nitroglycerin</strong>.</li>
<li>Wait another 5 minutes.</li>
<li>If pain still persists, <strong>administer a third dose of nitroglycerin</strong>.</li>
<li>If the pain is not relieved after three doses over 15 minutes, assume the patient is having a myocardial infarction (MI), activate emergency medical services (call 911), administer aspirin, and provide 100% oxygen.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The correct subsequent step after the first dose fails is to give a second dose.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 77:</h3>
<p>A four-year-old child has extensive caries causing pulp necrosis on teeth #51, #52, #61, and #62. The treatment plan is to carry out pulpectomy and restoration for these teeth under general anesthesia because the child is uncooperative. What is the most appropriate restorative treatment for these teeth after pulpectomy?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Composite restorations</li>
<li>B. Glass ionomer restorations</li>
<li>C. Stainless steel crowns</li>
<li><strong>D. Prefabricated zirconia crowns</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After a pulpectomy, a primary tooth is weakened and requires full coronal coverage for long-term success.</li>
<li><strong>Anterior Teeth:</strong> While composite (strip crowns) can be used, they are not as durable for teeth with extensive decay. Stainless steel crowns have poor aesthetics on anterior teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Prefabricated Zirconia Crowns</strong> are the most appropriate choice for restoring severely decayed primary anterior teeth. They offer excellent durability and superior aesthetics compared to other options. They provide full coverage, protecting the weakened tooth structure after the endodontic procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 78:</h3>
<p>A five-year-old patient presented to the clinic with his parents immediately after a traumatic incident, which resulted in an apical horizontal root fracture of tooth #62. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. No treatment is required</strong></li>
<li>B. Splint the tooth for 2-4 weeks</li>
<li>C. Extract the coronal fragment only</li>
<li>D. Perform a pulpectomy and restore the tooth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The management of a root fracture in a primary tooth depends on the mobility and displacement of the coronal fragment.</li>
<li>If the coronal fragment is <strong>not displaced and has no or minimal mobility</strong>, as is implied in this question where no such details are given, the prognosis for healing is good, and <strong>no active treatment is required</strong>. The tooth should simply be monitored.</li>
<li>Intervention (splinting or extraction of the coronal fragment) is only indicated if the coronal segment is significantly mobile or displaced, interfering with function or causing discomfort.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 79:</h3>
<p>Which of the following types of sutures may increase the risk of postoperative infection?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Non-resorbable monofilament suture</li>
<li>B. Resorbable monofilament suture</li>
<li>C. Non-resorbable braided suture</li>
<li><strong>D. Resorbable braided suture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Braided (Multifilament) Sutures</strong> have multiple strands twisted or woven together. This structure creates small interstices (gaps) between the filaments.</li>
<li>These gaps can harbor bacteria through a process called <strong>capillarity or "wicking effect"</strong>, where oral fluids and microorganisms are drawn along the length of the suture material into the wound.</li>
<li>This wicking effect increases the risk of surgical site infection compared to <strong>monofilament sutures</strong>, which are made of a single, smooth strand that does not harbor bacteria. Both resorbable and non-resorbable braided sutures have this property.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 80:</h3>
<p>What is the most appropriate location to take a sample for a cytological smear to confirm the diagnosis of a herpetic lesion?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Crusted lip lesion</li>
<li>B. Perilesional area</li>
<li>C. Surface of an intact vesicle</li>
<li><strong>D. Periphery of an ulcer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A cytological smear for herpes (Tzanck smear) aims to collect virally-infected epithelial cells.</li>
<li><strong>Ideal Sampling Technique:</strong> The highest yield of diagnostic cells is found at the <strong>base and periphery (margins) of a freshly ruptured vesicle (an ulcer)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Locations:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Surface of an intact vesicle:</strong> Will only yield normal, non-infected squamous cells from the roof of the blister.</li>
<li><strong>Vesicular fluid:</strong> Contains few cells and is not diagnostic.</li>
<li><strong>Crusted lesion:</strong> The crust must be removed first before the underlying ulcer base can be sampled.</li>
<li><strong>Perilesional area:</strong> This is normal tissue and will not contain infected cells.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The technique involves unroofing a vesicle and vigorously scraping the margins of the resulting ulcer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 81:</h3>
<p>After completing an extraction on a patient a couple of days ago, the patient returned to the clinic with the complaint that he experiences sharp pain on the lower lip with normal touch. The patient has a condition that is called:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Allodynia</strong></li>
<li>B. Hyperalgesia</li>
<li>C. Paresthesia</li>
<li>D. Dysesthesia</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This question tests the specific terminology for neuropathic pain sensations.</li>
<li><strong>Allodynia:</strong> Pain that is caused by a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain. In this case, "normal touch" is causing sharp pain. This is the definition of allodynia.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperalgesia:</strong> An <em>increased</em> or exaggerated pain response to a stimulus that <em>is</em> normally painful.</li>
<li><strong>Paresthesia:</strong> A general term for an abnormal sensation (like tingling or numbness), which is not necessarily painful.</li>
<li><strong>Dysesthesia:</strong> An unpleasant abnormal sensation, which can be spontaneous or evoked. Allodynia is a type of dysesthesia.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 82:</h3>
<p>Extraction of a tooth in an outpatient dental clinic is contraindicated in which of the following cases?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. A patient with a history of anaphylaxis to amoxicillin.</li>
<li>B. A well-controlled diabetic patient.</li>
<li>C. A patient with a history of myocardial infarction three months ago.</li>
<li><strong>D. A hypermobile tooth in an area of a cavernous hemangioma.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>cavernous hemangioma</strong> is a large, high-flow vascular malformation. Extracting a tooth from within such a lesion is extremely dangerous and can lead to immediate, profuse, and potentially uncontrollable hemorrhage.</li>
<li>This type of procedure is an absolute contraindication for an outpatient dental clinic and must only be performed in a hospital setting with a surgical team, blood products available, and the ability to manage a severe bleeding event.</li>
<li>The other options are manageable in a standard clinic: avoid amoxicillin, manage the diabetic patient appropriately, and wait at least 30 days post-MI for elective procedures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 83:</h3>
<p>Which of the following factors determines whether a fistula develops intraorally or extraorally?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Type of bacteria</li>
<li><strong>B. Location of muscle insertion</strong></li>
<li>C. Immune system of the host</li>
<li>D. Patient age</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The path an odontogenic infection takes as it perforates through the cortical bone is determined by the path of least resistance. This path is dictated by the attachment points of the facial and masticatory muscles.</li>
<li><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong><ul>
<li>If the perforation of the bone is <strong>above (superior to)</strong> the muscle attachment, the pus will be contained by the muscle and drain <strong>intraorally</strong> into the vestibule.</li>
<li>If the perforation is <strong>below (inferior to)</strong> the muscle attachment, the pus will travel into the fascial spaces of the face and neck, potentially leading to an <strong>extraoral</strong> fistula (draining through the skin).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, an infection from a mandibular molar perforating below the mylohyoid muscle attachment will enter the submandibular space (extraoral), while one perforating above it will enter the sublingual space (intraoral).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 84:</h3>
<p>Which of the following periodontal procedures commonly utilizes a coronally positioned flap as part of its surgical approach?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR)</strong></li>
<li>B. Crown lengthening</li>
<li>C. Open flap debridement</li>
<li>D. Osseous resective surgery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR)</strong> is a procedure used to regenerate lost periodontal structures (bone, PDL, cementum). It involves placing a barrier membrane over the bony defect.</li>
<li>To ensure this membrane is completely covered by soft tissue (a requirement for success), the flap must be advanced <strong>coronally</strong> to achieve primary closure over the membrane without tension.</li>
<li><strong>Apically Positioned Flaps</strong> are used for procedures like crown lengthening and osseous resective surgery, where the goal is to eliminate pockets by moving the gingival margin apically.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 85:</h3>
<p>A patient's right hypoglossal nerve is accidentally damaged during a surgical procedure involving the floor of the mouth. Which of the following is the most likely result of this injury?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Deviation of the tongue to the right upon protrusion.</strong></li>
<li>B. Deviation of the tongue to the left upon protrusion.</li>
<li>C. Loss of taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.</li>
<li>D. Loss of sensation to the floor of the mouth on the right side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)</strong> provides motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue.</li>
<li>The <strong>genioglossus muscle</strong> is the primary muscle responsible for protruding the tongue.</li>
<li>When a patient with a right hypoglossal nerve lesion attempts to stick their tongue out, the right genioglossus muscle is paralyzed and cannot push its side of the tongue forward. The left genioglossus muscle, working unopposed, pushes the left side of the tongue forward.</li>
<li>The net result is that the tongue <strong>deviates toward the side of the lesion</strong> (the paralyzed side). Therefore, a right-sided lesion causes deviation to the right.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 86:</h3>
<p>An article reporting the beneficial effect of using fluoridated toothpaste over a non-fluoridated one reported a p-value of 0.015. What does this p-value signify?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. The result is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.</strong></li>
<li>B. The result is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.</li>
<li>C. The result is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is accepted.</li>
<li>D. The result is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P-value:</strong> The p-value represents the probability of observing the study results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis were true. The null hypothesis states there is no difference between the groups.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Level:</strong> The standard cutoff for statistical significance (the alpha level, α) is typically set at 0.05.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong><ul>
<li>If <strong>p &lt; 0.05</strong>, the result is considered <strong>statistically significant</strong>. This means the observed difference is unlikely to be due to chance. We therefore <strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong> in favor of the alternative hypothesis (that there is a real difference).</li>
<li>If <strong>p ≥ 0.05</strong>, the result is <strong>not statistically significant</strong>, and we <strong>fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since p = 0.015, which is less than 0.05, the result is statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 87:</h3>
<p>Prolonged bleeding after a tooth extraction may be associated with the administration of which of the following drugs?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)</li>
<li><strong>B. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</strong></li>
<li>C. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)</li>
<li>D. Barbiturates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSRIs</strong> (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline) work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin in the brain. However, they also block the uptake of serotonin into <strong>platelets</strong>.</li>
<li>Serotonin is crucial for promoting platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, which are essential steps in forming a platelet plug (primary hemostasis).</li>
<li>By depleting platelets of serotonin, SSRIs impair platelet function and can lead to a prolonged bleeding time and an increased risk of abnormal bleeding, particularly after surgical procedures like extractions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 88:</h3>
<p>Intranuclear viral inclusions are characteristic histopathologic findings in which of the following oral conditions?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Hairy leukoplakia</li>
<li>B. Hodgkin's lymphoma</li>
<li><strong>C. Infectious mononucleosis</strong></li>
<li>D. White sponge nevus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intranuclear inclusions</strong> are aggregates of viral proteins or particles that form within the nucleus of an infected cell, disrupting its normal appearance. They are a hallmark of certain viral infections.</li>
<li><strong>Infectious Mononucleosis</strong> is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In histopathology, EBV-infected lymphocytes can show these characteristic intranuclear viral inclusions.</li>
<li>While hairy leukoplakia is also associated with EBV, its histological appearance is more typically described as having "smudgy" nuclei or ballooning cells, rather than the classic clear inclusions seen in mononucleosis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 89:</h3>
<p>In a patient with a skeletal Class II relationship, 100% overbite, and 1 mm overjet who is scheduled for orthognathic surgery, what is the main purpose of the presurgical orthodontic treatment?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Decrease the overbite</li>
<li>B. Maintain the overjet</li>
<li><strong>C. Increase the overjet</strong></li>
<li>D. Decrease the overjet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This patient has a skeletal Class II malocclusion (retruded mandible), but the teeth have compensated for it. The maxillary incisors are retroclined, and the mandibular incisors are proclined, which has masked the underlying skeletal problem by reducing the overjet. This is called <strong>dental compensation</strong>.</li>
<li>The purpose of presurgical orthodontics is <strong>decompensation</strong>: to move the teeth into their ideal positions over their respective skeletal bases, <em>before</em> the jaws are surgically moved.</li>
<li>For a Class II patient, this involves <strong>proclining the retroclined maxillary incisors</strong> and/or <strong>retroclining the proclined mandibular incisors</strong>. Both of these movements will <strong>increase the overjet</strong>, making the malocclusion look worse temporarily.</li>
<li>This increased overjet is necessary to allow the surgeon to advance the mandible forward into the correct Class I skeletal and dental relationship. The deep overbite is typically corrected by the surgery itself and post-surgical orthodontics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 90:</h3>
<p>A patient is scheduled to start chemotherapy. Dental evaluation concluded that the patient required extraction of multiple teeth. What is the ideal timing for the extraction of these teeth?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. One week prior to starting chemotherapy</li>
<li>B. Two weeks prior to starting chemotherapy</li>
<li><strong>C. Three weeks prior to starting chemotherapy</strong></li>
<li>D. Extractions can be carried out anytime</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is crucial to perform any necessary extractions well before the start of chemotherapy or radiotherapy to allow for adequate healing of the socket. This prevents complications like infection or osteoradionecrosis when the patient becomes myelosuppressed.</li>
<li>The guidelines state that the <strong>ideal</strong> healing time is <strong>three weeks (21 days)</strong>.</li>
<li>While a minimum of 10-14 days is sometimes cited as acceptable, three weeks is the preferred and ideal timeframe to ensure robust soft tissue and initial bony healing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 91:</h3>
<p>Deflective contacts between the mesial inclines of maxillary teeth and the distal inclines of mandibular teeth will result in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Anterior deflection of the mandible</strong></li>
<li>B. Posterior deflection of the mandible</li>
<li>C. Lateral deflection of the mandible to the right</li>
<li>D. Lateral deflection of the mandible to the left</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This describes a specific type of occlusal prematurity that occurs as the jaw closes from centric relation into maximum intercuspation.</li>
<li>Imagine the mandible closing. If the <strong>distal-facing inclines</strong> of the lower teeth hit the <strong>mesial-facing inclines</strong> of the upper teeth prematurely, the mandible has nowhere to go but to slide <strong>forward and upward</strong> along these inclined planes to reach full closure.</li>
<li>This is a classic "slide from CR to MIP" and results in an <strong>anterior deflection of the mandible</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 92:</h3>
<p>A nine-year-old patient presents with tooth #11 in anterior crossbite and maxillary crowding. What is the most appropriate appliance to correct the crossbite and manage the crowding?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Removable Hawley appliance with a Z-spring</li>
<li>B. Functional appliance (e.g., Twin Block)</li>
<li>C. Full fixed appliances with brackets and archwire</li>
<li><strong>D. Sectional fixed appliance (2x4 appliance)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Correcting an anterior crossbite requires space. Since the patient has crowding, there is not enough space to simply push the tooth forward with a removable appliance like a Hawley.</li>
<li>A <strong>2x4 appliance</strong> is the ideal choice in the mixed dentition for this situation. It consists of brackets on the four maxillary incisors and bands on the two maxillary first permanent molars.</li>
<li>This appliance is highly effective because it can perform multiple actions simultaneously:<ol>
<li><strong>Create Space:</strong> The archwire can be used to align the incisors and distalize the canines if needed, resolving the crowding.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Crossbite:</strong> Once space is available, the wire can be used to efficiently move the tooth in crossbite forward into its correct position.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Full fixed appliances are for the permanent dentition. A functional appliance is for correcting skeletal Class II discrepancies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 93:</h3>
<p>In a patient who is taking imipramine and presents for scaling and routine dental examination, what precautions should be taken during the dental procedure?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Refer to a physician for further assessment prior to treatment.</li>
<li>B. Discontinue the use of imipramine prior to the dental procedure.</li>
<li><strong>C. Elevate the dental chair slowly after the procedure.</strong></li>
<li>D. No special consideration is required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imipramine is a <strong>tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)</strong>.</li>
<li>One of the most common and clinically significant side effects of TCAs is <strong>orthostatic hypotension</strong>. This is a sudden drop in blood pressure that occurs when standing up or changing position from supine to upright too quickly, which can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting (syncope).</li>
<li>The primary precaution for a dental professional is to <strong>raise the dental chair slowly and in stages</strong> at the end of the appointment, allowing the patient's cardiovascular system time to adjust and preventing an orthostatic event.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 94:</h3>
<p>During a mandibular lateral shift movement, which of the following best describes the movement of the rotating condyle?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It moves anteriorly and medially.</li>
<li><strong>B. It moves posteriorly and laterally.</strong></li>
<li>C. It remains stationary in the fossa.</li>
<li>D. It moves inferiorly and anteriorly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During a lateral excursion (e.g., a right lateral movement):</li>
<li><strong>Working Side (Right Side):</strong> The condyle on the side the mandible is moving <em>toward</em> is called the <strong>rotating condyle</strong>. It primarily rotates within the glenoid fossa but also shifts slightly <strong>posteriorly and laterally</strong>. This entire movement of the mandible to the side is called the Bennett movement.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Working Side (Left Side):</strong> The condyle on the side the mandible is moving <em>away from</em> is called the <strong>orbiting or advancing condyle</strong>. It moves <strong>anteriorly, inferiorly, and medially</strong> down the articular eminence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 95:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is considered the first clinical manifestation of local anesthetic toxicity?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Drowsiness</li>
<li>B. Tinnitus</li>
<li>C. Metallic taste</li>
<li><strong>D. Dizziness</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Local anesthetic toxicity affects the Central Nervous System (CNS) in a biphasic manner: initial excitation followed by depression.</li>
<li>The <strong>earliest signs</strong> are typically related to CNS excitation. These are often subtle and can include:<ul>
<li>Lightheadedness and <strong>dizziness</strong></li>
<li>Nervousness, apprehension, talkativeness</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and a metallic taste can also occur early but are considered more non-specific.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drowsiness</strong> is a sign of CNS <strong>depression</strong>, which occurs in the later, more severe stages of toxicity. Of the options provided, dizziness is the most reliable early excitatory sign.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 96:</h3>
<p>After apicectomy and MTA retrofill, which of the following describes the normal histological appearance at the apex?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Formation of a fibrous capsule around the apex and MTA</li>
<li><strong>B. Formation of cementum directly over the MTA</strong></li>
<li>C. Insertion of periodontal ligament fibers parallel to the MTA</li>
<li>D. Direct contact of new bone with the MTA</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is a highly biocompatible and bioactive material.</li>
<li>One of its remarkable properties is the ability to induce hard tissue formation. Histological studies have consistently shown that when MTA is placed as a root-end filling material, it promotes the regeneration of a new layer of <strong>cementum</strong> that forms directly on its surface.</li>
<li>This new cementum layer then allows for the re-establishment of a functional periodontal ligament, with fibers inserting into both the new cementum and the adjacent alveolar bone, leading to true periodontal regeneration.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 97:</h3>
<p>How frequently should dental unit waterlines be purged?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. After every patient</li>
<li><strong>B. Once every morning</strong></li>
<li>C. Once a week</li>
<li>D. Only when visibly contaminated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This question refers to the general purging of <strong>all</strong> waterlines in the dental unit to reduce the microbial load from overnight stagnation.</li>
<li>Infection control guidelines mandate that at the <strong>beginning of each day</strong>, all waterlines should be flushed for <strong>2-3 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li>It's important to differentiate this from the short (20-30 second) flush of specific instruments like the air/water syringe and high-speed handpiece that is performed <strong>between each patient</strong>. The question asks about the "dental unit waterlines" as a whole system, for which the daily purge is the correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 98:</h3>
<p>The microbiota associated with the generalized form of early-onset periodontitis (now termed generalized Grade C periodontitis) is predominated by all of the following microorganisms EXCEPT:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. <em>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</em></strong></li>
<li>B. <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis</em></li>
<li>C. <em>Treponema denticola</em></li>
<li>D. <em>Tannerella forsythia</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>P. gingivalis</em>, <em>T. denticola</em>, and <em>T. forsythia</em> make up the "Red Complex," a group of pathogens strongly associated with severe and progressive forms of periodontitis, including what was formerly called generalized aggressive periodontitis.</li>
<li><strong><em>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</em> (Aa)</strong>, while a potent periodontal pathogen, is classically and most strongly associated with the <strong>localized</strong> form of aggressive periodontitis (now known as the "molar-incisor pattern"). It is not considered a predominant organism in the generalized form.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 99:</h3>
<p>A five-year-old patient presents with a complaint of toothache triggered by cold water. Radiographic examination reveals distal caries on tooth #74 extending to the pulp with no signs of periapical pathology or furcation involvement. What is the most appropriate treatment?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Indirect pulp capping</li>
<li>B. Pulpectomy and amalgam restoration</li>
<li><strong>C. Pulpotomy and stainless steel crown</strong></li>
<li>D. Pulpectomy and stainless steel crown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The pain is triggered by cold but is not spontaneous, and there are no radiographic signs of irreversible change (like furcation involvement). This indicates <strong>reversible pulpitis</strong>, even with a carious exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment for Reversible Pulpitis in a Primary Molar:</strong> The standard of care is a <strong>pulpotomy</strong>. This involves removing the coronal portion of the pulp, placing a medicament (like formocresol or MTA), and sealing the tooth.</li>
<li><strong>Restoration:</strong> After a pulpotomy, the tooth is weakened and requires full coronal coverage to prevent fracture. The restoration of choice for a primary molar after pulp therapy is a <strong>stainless steel crown (SSC)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 100:</h3>
<p>After sedation with nitrous oxide, what is the minimal amount of time that the patient must be kept on 100% oxygen before being discharged?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. 1 minute</li>
<li>B. 2 minutes</li>
<li><strong>C. 3-5 minutes</strong></li>
<li>D. 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of a procedure involving nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation, the nitrous oxide must be turned off, and the patient must breathe <strong>100% oxygen</strong> for a period of time.</li>
<li>This is done to prevent <strong>diffusion hypoxia</strong>. Nitrous oxide is rapidly eliminated from the blood into the alveoli of the lungs. This rapid outward diffusion can dilute the concentration of oxygen in the lungs, leading to a temporary drop in blood oxygen saturation, which can cause headache, nausea, and lethargy.</li>
<li>Administering 100% oxygen for a minimum of <strong>3-5 minutes</strong> effectively flushes out the residual nitrous oxide and prevents this complication.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Of course. Here is the comprehensive study guide on the Multiple Choice Questions from the Day 2 lecture transcript, formatted for your review.</p>
<h3>Question 2:</h3>
<p>A six-year-old patient presents with pain from tooth #85. Clinical and radiographic examination reveals deep caries with pulp exposure. During pulpotomy, bleeding from the radicular pulp is uncontrolled. Tooth #84 has extensive caries and is non-restorable. Which of the following is the most significant treatment for tooth #84 and #85?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Pulpectomy of tooth #85 with composite restoration. Extract tooth #84 and place a band and loop space maintainer.</li>
<li>B. Pulpotomy on tooth #85 with stainless steel crown. Extract tooth #84 and place a crown and loop space maintainer.</li>
<li>C. Extract both #84 and #85 and place a lingual arch space maintainer.</li>
<li><strong>D. Perform pulpectomy on tooth #85 with a stainless steel crown. Extract tooth #84 and place a crown and loop space maintainer.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tooth #85:</strong> The initial plan may have been a pulpotomy, but the fact that bleeding from the radicular pulp is uncontrolled is a definitive sign of irreversible pulpitis extending into the root. This contraindicates a pulpotomy and makes a <strong>pulpectomy</strong> the required treatment. The ideal restoration after endodontic treatment on a primary molar is a <strong>stainless steel crown (SSC)</strong> for durability.</li>
<li><strong>Tooth #84:</strong> This tooth is non-restorable and requires <strong>extraction</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Space Maintenance:</strong> Since the patient is only six, the extraction of #84 will lead to space loss. A space maintainer is required. Since an SSC is being placed on #85, the ideal space maintainer is a <strong>crown and loop</strong>, where the loop is soldered directly to the crown on #85 to hold the space for #84.</li>
<li><strong>Option B is incorrect</strong> because a pulpotomy is not indicated due to the uncontrolled bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p>A 57-year-old male patient presents for root canal treatment of an asymptomatic mandibular molar. The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c of 10%. After local anesthesia is administered, the patient becomes diaphoretic and pale. Shortly after, the patient loses consciousness. Which of the following medications is the most suitable for the management of this emergency?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Epinephrine</li>
<li>B. Insulin</li>
<li>C. Oral glucose</li>
<li><strong>D. Intravenous glucagon</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The patient's signs and symptoms (diaphoresis/sweating, pallor, rapid loss of consciousness) are classic for <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> (low blood sugar). Even with a high HbA1c (indicating poor long-term control), acute hypoglycemic events are a common and dangerous complication. Hypoglycemia has a rapid onset, whereas hyperglycemia develops more slowly.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> The treatment for hypoglycemia is to administer sugar. However, the patient has lost consciousness, making it unsafe to administer anything orally (like oral glucose or juice) due to the risk of aspiration.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Action:</strong> In an unconscious hypoglycemic patient, the correct management is to administer <strong>intravenous (or intramuscular) glucagon</strong>. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release stored glucose, rapidly raising blood sugar levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 4:</h3>
<p>What is the main disadvantage of using bioceramic sealers during obturation?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. High risk of tissue irritation in case of extrusion of the sealer.</li>
<li>B. Low flowability of the sealer results in increased voids within the obturation.</li>
<li>C. Bioceramic sealers have a slow setting reaction.</li>
<li>D. Bioceramic sealers do not adhere to the dentinal wall of the root canal.</li>
<li><strong>E. Bioceramic sealers increase the difficulty of endodontic retreatment.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bioceramic sealers have many advantages: they are highly biocompatible (A is false), have excellent flow (B is false), are adhesive (D is false), and have a slow setting time which is an advantage, not a disadvantage (C is false).</li>
<li>The primary drawback is that once they set, they become very hard. This hardness makes them difficult to remove from the canal if endodontic retreatment becomes necessary in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 5:</h3>
<p>A patient's medical history is significant for epilepsy, for which he takes carbamazepine. In case of an odontogenic infection, which of the following antibiotics is contraindicated?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Amoxicillin</li>
<li>B. Penicillin</li>
<li>C. Azithromycin</li>
<li><strong>D. Clarithromycin</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a significant drug interaction between <strong>carbamazepine</strong> and certain macrolide antibiotics, specifically <strong>clarithromycin</strong> and <strong>erythromycin</strong>.</li>
<li>These macrolides inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine, leading to increased, potentially toxic levels of carbamazepine in the blood. This can result in side effects like ataxia, vertigo, and drowsiness.</li>
<li>Azithromycin is also a macrolide but does not typically cause this interaction. Therefore, clarithromycin should be avoided in a patient taking carbamazepine.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 6:</h3>
<p>An adult patient is to undergo orthodontic treatment to correct retruded mandibular incisors, which show healthy gingival condition and minimal width of attached gingiva and a shallow labial vestibule. Which of the following periodontal surgeries is required prior to orthodontic treatment?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Laterally positioned flap graft</li>
<li><strong>B. Free gingival graft</strong></li>
<li>C. Guided tissue regeneration</li>
<li>D. Subepithelial connective tissue graft</li>
<li>E. No periodontal procedure is required prior to orthodontic treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The patient has two key risk factors for gingival recession: (1) a minimal width of attached gingiva and (2) a planned orthodontic movement (protrusion of the incisors) that will push the roots labially, further thinning the buccal plate of bone.</li>
<li>To prevent recession from occurring during treatment, it is necessary to augment the gingival tissue <em>before</em> starting orthodontics.</li>
<li>A <strong>free gingival graft</strong> is the most predictable procedure for increasing the width and thickness of attached keratinized gingiva in the mandibular anterior region. A subepithelial connective tissue graft is used primarily for root coverage, not for creating new attached gingiva where none exists.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 7:</h3>
<p>If a rotary endodontic instrument has a progressively increasing taper from the tip of the instrument to the coronal aspect, this instrument will:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Enlarge the canal mainly in the coronal third.</strong></li>
<li>B. Enlarge the canal mainly in the apical third.</li>
<li>C. Enlarge the canal mainly in the middle third.</li>
<li>D. Enlarge the canal equally in all thirds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>progressively increasing taper</strong> means the instrument's diameter increases more rapidly as you move from the tip towards the handle. For example, the taper might be 2% at the tip but 8% near the coronal end.</li>
<li>This design concentrates the cutting action in the wider, more tapered sections of the instrument.</li>
<li>Therefore, an instrument with a progressive taper is designed to primarily shape and enlarge the <strong>coronal and middle thirds</strong> of the root canal, consistent with a crown-down preparation philosophy. Instruments designed for apical finishing often have a regressive taper (larger taper at the tip).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 8:</h3>
<p>During the try-in of an all-ceramic crown, what is the most appropriate way to check for the presence or absence of occlusal contact with the opposing tooth?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Articulating paper</li>
<li><strong>B. Shim stock</strong></li>
<li>C. Wax</li>
<li>D. Additional silicone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a critical difference between checking for the <em>presence</em> of a contact versus its <em>location</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Shim Stock:</strong> This is an extremely thin (approx. 8 microns) metal foil. It is the most reliable indicator for confirming the <strong>presence or absence</strong> of a contact. If the shim stock holds when the patient bites, there is contact. If it pulls through without resistance, there is no contact.</li>
<li><strong>Articulating Paper:</strong> This is much thicker (40-100+ microns). It is used to identify the <strong>location</strong> of contacts by leaving a colored mark. However, its thickness can create a false positive; it may feel like there is contact when there isn't one, simply due to the paper's bulk. Therefore, for initial confirmation of contact, shim stock is superior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 9:</h3>
<p>In group-guided occlusion, which of the following best describes the posterior occlusal contact pattern during lateral excursion?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Posterior teeth are in contact during lateral excursions on the working side only.</strong></li>
<li>B. Posterior teeth are in contact during lateral excursion on the working and non-working sides.</li>
<li>C. No contact between the posterior teeth on both the working and the non-working side.</li>
<li>D. No contact between posterior teeth on the working side, but there is contact on the non-working side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group Function (Group-Guided) Occlusion:</strong> During a lateral excursive movement, the guidance is shared among a group of teeth on the <strong>working side</strong>. This typically includes the canine and the posterior teeth (premolars and sometimes the mesiobuccal cusp of the first molar). There are no contacts on the non-working (balancing) side.</li>
<li><strong>Canine Guidance:</strong> All posterior teeth on both the working and non-working sides are discluded immediately by the canines.</li>
<li><strong>Balanced Occlusion:</strong> There are simultaneous contacts on both the working and non-working sides. This is typically used for complete dentures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 10:</h3>
<p>Which of the following irrigation agents minimizes the risk of accidental fracture of rotary instruments?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Sodium hypochlorite</strong></li>
<li>B. Hydrogen peroxide</li>
<li>C. Calcium hydroxide</li>
<li>D. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The key to minimizing fracture risk from torque and friction is <strong>lubrication</strong>.</li>
<li>While EDTA is a chelating agent that softens dentin, its action is too slow to provide effective lubrication during active instrumentation. The file cuts the dentin before the EDTA has time to soften it.</li>
<li>The most effective lubricant is a thin, <strong>aqueous solution</strong> that can continuously flow around the instrument. Standard <strong>sodium hypochlorite</strong> solution provides excellent lubrication, reducing the torque generated on the file during rotation and thus lowering the risk of cyclic fatigue and fracture. Paste-based lubricants are less effective than aqueous solutions for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 11:</h3>
<p>A patient presents to your clinic complaining of white spot lesions on maxillary incisors. The patient has just had their orthodontic braces removed. According to the ICDAS, these tooth surfaces are given which of the following codes?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Code 0</li>
<li>B. Code 1</li>
<li><strong>C. Code 2</strong></li>
<li>D. Code 3</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> White spot lesions that appear around orthodontic brackets are a result of demineralization due to plaque accumulation. They are the earliest visible stage of a carious lesion.</li>
<li><strong>ICDAS Codes for Non-Cavitated Lesions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Code 0:</strong> Sound tooth surface.</li>
<li><strong>Code 1:</strong> First visual change in enamel (white or brown spot) that is only visible <strong>after prolonged air drying</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Code 2:</strong> Distinct visual change in enamel (white or brown spot) that is clearly visible when the tooth is <strong>wet</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since these post-orthodontic white spots are distinct and visible to the patient without special drying, they are classified as <strong>Code 2</strong>. Code 3 would involve a microcavitation or initial breakdown of the enamel surface.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 12:</h3>
<p>Cephalometric analysis reveals an increased interincisal angle. Clinically, the patient will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Reduced overjet and reduced overbite</li>
<li>B. Increased overjet and increased overbite</li>
<li>C. Increased overjet and reduced overbite</li>
<li><strong>D. Reduced overjet and increased overbite</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The interincisal angle is the angle formed by the long axes of the maxillary and mandibular incisors.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Interincisal Angle:</strong> This means the incisors are more upright or even retroclined. When the maxillary incisor is more upright, it moves posteriorly, which <strong>reduces the horizontal overlap (overjet)</strong>. At the same time, this upright position causes a greater <strong>vertical overlap (increased overbite)</strong>, leading to a deep bite.</li>
<li><strong>Decreased Interincisal Angle:</strong> This means the incisors are more proclined or flared out. This <strong>increases the overjet</strong> but <strong>reduces the overbite</strong>, leading to a shallow bite or open bite tendency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 13:</h3>
<p>In a study on occupational exposure and cancer risk, participants who were diagnosed with cancer are more likely to remember past exposures. Which of the following biases is most likely to occur?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Sampling bias</li>
<li>B. Selection bias</li>
<li><strong>C. Recall bias</strong></li>
<li>D. Conforming bias</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recall Bias:</strong> This is a systematic error that occurs in case-control studies when there are differences in the accuracy or completeness of recollections of past events or exposures between the "cases" (those with the disease) and the "controls" (those without).</li>
<li>Individuals who have developed a disease (like cancer) are often motivated to think deeply about past exposures that may have caused it, leading to a more detailed memory than healthy individuals, who have no such motivation. This differential recall can skew the results and create a false association.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 14:</h3>
<p>What is the most likely diagnosis of a non-corticated, dome-shaped radiopacity in the maxillary sinus?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Maxillary sinus retention cyst (Antral pseudocyst)</strong></li>
<li>B. Maxillary sinusitis</li>
<li>C. Malignancy affecting the maxillary sinus</li>
<li>D. Foreign body in the maxillary sinus</li>
<li>E. Periapical infection of a maxillary molar</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "dome-shaped, non-corticated radiopacity" arising from the floor of the maxillary sinus is the classic radiographic description of an <strong>antral pseudocyst</strong>, also known as a maxillary sinus retention cyst. It is a common, asymptomatic, incidental finding.</li>
<li><strong>Key Differentiator:</strong> The lack of cortication is crucial. A periapical infection from a maxillary molar can also create a dome-shaped opacity as it pushes the sinus floor upwards, but this opacity will be <strong>corticated</strong> (it is the bony floor of the sinus itself). Malignancy would show destruction of the sinus floor, not a smooth dome. Sinusitis presents as a diffuse thickening of the entire sinus lining.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 15:</h3>
<p>In orthodontic therapy using fixed appliances, what is the function of large rectangular stainless steel wires?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Derotating the teeth</li>
<li><strong>B. Torquing of the roots</strong></li>
<li>C. Tipping teeth in a mesial-distal direction</li>
<li>D. Moving the teeth in a buccal-lingual direction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Orthodontic treatment progresses from small, flexible round wires to larger, stiffer rectangular wires.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Wires (Small, Round):</strong> Used for leveling, aligning, and derotating teeth. They engage the bracket slot loosely and are good for tipping movements.</li>
<li><strong>Finishing Wires (Large, Rectangular, Stainless Steel):</strong> These wires fully engage the rectangular slot of the bracket. This full engagement allows the wire to exert a moment or a "couple," which is necessary to produce <strong>torque</strong>. Torque is the buccolingual movement of the root, which is essential for achieving proper root angulation and finishing the case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 16:</h3>
<p>Following phase one periodontal therapy, a patient returned to the clinic eight weeks later for periodontal re-evaluation. The patient has optimal oral health with the exception of a residual pocket and bleeding on probing only on the mesial aspect of tooth #34. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Administer 20 mg of sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD)</li>
<li><strong>B. Administer a local antibiotic to the mesial aspect of tooth #34.</strong></li>
<li>C. Prescribe 100 mg of systemic doxycycline.</li>
<li>D. Repeat non-surgical debridement therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The patient has responded well to initial therapy everywhere except for one specific, localized site. This makes it a localized problem that calls for a localized solution.</li>
<li><strong>Locally Delivered Antibiotics (LDAs):</strong> Products like Arestin (minocycline microspheres) or PerioChip (chlorhexidine chip) are designed for exactly this scenario. They are placed directly into the residual pocket to deliver a high concentration of an antimicrobial agent to eliminate the persistent bacteria.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Systemic Antibiotics (C) or SDD (A):</strong> These are systemic treatments and are overkill for a single localized problem.</li>
<li><strong>Repeating Debridement (D):</strong> While often done in conjunction with LDAs, it's unlikely to solve the problem on its own if it failed the first time. The LDA is the key adjunctive therapy here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 17:</h3>
<p>A 51-year-old female patient presents to the clinic complaining of severe pain in a lower tooth when drinking cold water and eating on the left side. The patient has a removable partial denture in the mandible. Tooth #34 has deep caries extending subgingivally close to the alveolar crest. The patient's medical history is significant for a metastatic bone cancer for which she is taking zoledronate. What is the most appropriate treatment plan?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Caries excavation and composite buildup of tooth #34.</li>
<li>B. Extraction of tooth #34 and adding an acrylic tooth to the denture to replace it.</li>
<li>C. Root canal treatment of tooth #34 followed by crown lengthening and crown placement.</li>
<li><strong>D. Root canal treatment of tooth #34 followed by coronectomy and adding an acrylic tooth to the denture to replace it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The patient is taking zoledronate, an intravenous bisphosphonate, which carries a high risk of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ). Therefore, any procedure involving bone manipulation (extraction, crown lengthening) must be avoided if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Analyzing the Options:</strong><ul>
<li>Options B (extraction) and C (crown lengthening) involve surgery and bone manipulation and are thus contraindicated.</li>
<li>Option A (composite buildup) is not feasible as the tooth is unrestorable without crown lengthening and requires endodontic treatment due to the severe pain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Best (Most Conservative) Option:</strong> Option D provides the safest course of action.<ol>
<li><strong>Root Canal Treatment:</strong> This eliminates the pain and infection from the pulp.</li>
<li><strong>Coronectomy:</strong> Removing the crown down to the gum level eliminates the non-restorable portion of the tooth without disturbing the root or surrounding bone.</li>
<li><strong>Adding a Denture Tooth:</strong> This provides an aesthetic and functional replacement without any surgery.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This approach manages the patient's acute problem while completely avoiding the risk of triggering MRONJ.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 18:</h3>
<p>Which of the following conditions is associated with short roots and periapical radiolucencies?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Dentin dysplasia type I</strong></li>
<li>B. Dentin dysplasia type II</li>
<li>C. Dentinogenesis imperfecta</li>
<li>D. Amelogenesis imperfecta</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dentin Dysplasia Type I (Radicular Type):</strong> This is the condition classically described as "rootless teeth." It is characterized by teeth with normal-appearing crowns but extremely short, blunted, or conical roots. Due to the defective root structure, these teeth are prone to mobility and often develop multiple periapical radiolucencies (cysts or granulomas) without an obvious cause like caries.</li>
<li><strong>Dentin Dysplasia Type II (Coronal Type):</strong> Affects the pulp chambers ("thistle-tube" appearance), but root length is normal.</li>
<li><strong>Dentinogenesis Imperfecta:</strong> Features bulbous crowns, cervical constriction, and obliterated pulp canals, but not characteristically short roots.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 19:</h3>
<p>Which of the following is LEAST likely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</li>
<li>B. Nasopharyngeal cancer</li>
<li><strong>C. Gastric cancer</strong></li>
<li>D. Burkitt's lymphoma</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus strongly linked to several malignancies.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Associations:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Burkitt's Lymphoma:</strong> Particularly the endemic African type.</li>
<li><strong>Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma:</strong> Especially common in Southern China.</li>
<li><strong>Hodgkin's Lymphoma:</strong> A subset of cases.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas:</strong> Especially in immunocompromised individuals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gastric Cancer:</strong> While EBV can be found in a small percentage (around 10%) of gastric adenocarcinomas, the association is much weaker and less established compared to the other lymphomas and nasopharyngeal cancer. Therefore, it is the <em>least likely</em> to be associated among the given options.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 20:</h3>
<p>If an implant is placed to restore a missing central incisor in a 14-year-old patient, which of the following is expected to take place after ten years?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Supra-occlusion</li>
<li><strong>B. Infra-occlusion</strong></li>
<li>C. Severe ridge resorption</li>
<li>D. No significant change</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Placing an implant in a growing patient is contraindicated for this very reason.</li>
<li>An implant, once osseointegrated, becomes ankylosed to the bone and does not move.</li>
<li>The adjacent natural teeth, however, continue to erupt and drift along with the vertical and horizontal growth of the alveolar bone, which continues into the late teens and even early twenties.</li>
<li>Over time, the adjacent natural teeth will continue to erupt inferiorly, while the implant remains fixed in its original position. This will make the implant crown appear short and submerged relative to the adjacent teeth, a state known as <strong>infra-occlusion</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 21:</h3>
<p>A 50-year-old male with controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c is 6.8%) and a 15-year history of smoking one pack per day presents for a consultation regarding implant placement in the mandibular left molar region. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed 10 mm of bone height above the inferior alveolar canal and 6 mm of bone width. What is the most appropriate course of action?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Defer implant treatment until the patient stops smoking and the HbA1c falls below 6%.</li>
<li><strong>B. Proceed with implant placement using the standard implant protocol and inform the patient of the increased risk of implant failure.</strong></li>
<li>C. Perform a ridge augmentation procedure prior to implant placement.</li>
<li>D. Refer the patient for hyperbaric oxygen therapy prior to surgery.</li>
<li>E. Reject implant placement and recommend a removable partial denture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessing Contraindications:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> The patient's diabetes is <strong>well-controlled</strong> (HbA1c &lt; 7.0%), which is not a contraindication to implant surgery.</li>
<li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Smoking is a significant risk factor that decreases implant success rates, but it is a <strong>relative contraindication</strong>, not an absolute one.</li>
<li><strong>Bone Volume:</strong> The available bone (10mm height, 6mm width) is sufficient for placing a standard implant without needing augmentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Action:</strong> Since there are no absolute contraindications, it is appropriate to <strong>proceed with implant placement</strong>. However, it is ethically and legally mandatory to have a thorough discussion with the patient, informing them that their smoking habit significantly increases the risk of complications and implant failure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 22:</h3>
<p>Which of the following statements regarding the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is FALSE?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. It plays a key role in neutrophil and other immune cell recruitment to the site of inflammation.</strong></li>
<li>B. It induces the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).</li>
<li>C. It contributes significantly to alveolar bone loss in periodontitis.</li>
<li>D. It can be inhibited by the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PGE2 is a potent pro-inflammatory mediator in periodontal disease.</li>
<li><strong>Its True Roles:</strong><ul>
<li>It <strong>induces the production of MMPs</strong>, which are enzymes that degrade collagen and other connective tissues (Statement B is true).</li>
<li>It directly stimulates osteoclasts, leading to <strong>alveolar bone resorption</strong> (Statement C is true).</li>
<li>As a prostaglandin, its synthesis is blocked by <strong>NSAIDs</strong> (Statement D is true).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Its False Role:</strong> The recruitment of immune cells like neutrophils to the site of inflammation is the primary role of <strong>chemokines</strong> (e.g., IL-8), not prostaglandins. Therefore, statement A is false.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 23:</h3>
<p>A 21-year-old female patient presents with a complaint of gradual facial asymmetry over the past two years. A panoramic radiograph reveals a diffusely opaque lesion in the right maxilla. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum calcium, and alkaline phosphatase, are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Fibrous dysplasia</strong></li>
<li>B. Ossifying fibroma</li>
<li>C. Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis</li>
<li>D. Paget's disease of the bone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This presentation is classic for monostotic <strong>fibrous dysplasia</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Age:</strong> Develops in younger patients (children and young adults).</li>
<li><strong>Location/Symmetry:</strong> Typically <strong>unilateral</strong> and common in the maxilla, causing gradual, painless expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Radiographic Appearance:</strong> Presents as a <strong>diffuse</strong>, ill-defined lesion with a characteristic <strong>"ground-glass"</strong> opacity.</li>
<li><strong>Lab Tests:</strong> Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase are typically <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Differentiating from Others:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Paget's Disease:</strong> Affects older patients, is often bilateral or polyostotic, and shows elevated alkaline phosphatase.</li>
<li><strong>Ossifying Fibroma:</strong> Is a well-defined, encapsulated lesion, not diffuse.</li>
<li><strong>Osteomyelitis:</strong> Is an infection and would present with pain, fever, and other signs of inflammation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 24:</h3>
<p>A patient presents to your clinic for dental examination. You notice that his lower lip is dry and scaly with some areas of ulceration. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Incisional biopsy</strong></li>
<li>B. Excisional biopsy</li>
<li>C. Intralesional corticosteroids</li>
<li>D. Topical antimicrobial ointment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The description of a dry, scaly lower lip with areas of ulceration in a sun-exposed area is highly suggestive of <strong>actinic cheilitis</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Nature of the Lesion:</strong> Actinic cheilitis is a pre-malignant condition that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of <strong>ulceration</strong>, induration, or thickening are clinical signs that raise suspicion of malignant transformation.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> Because of the risk of malignancy, any suspicious area within the actinic cheilitis (especially an ulcerated area) <strong>must be biopsied</strong>. An <strong>incisional biopsy</strong> is the correct procedure to obtain a representative tissue sample for histopathological diagnosis to rule out or confirm carcinoma.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 25:</h3>
<p>Which of the following statements is true concerning cellular intrinsic fiber cementum?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It plays an important role in tooth attachment.</li>
<li>B. It covers the coronal half of the root.</li>
<li>C. Its intrinsic fibers run perpendicular to the root surface.</li>
<li>D. Its intrinsic fibers have larger diameters compared to extrinsic fibers.</li>
<li><strong>E. A thin and unmineralized layer of organic matrix is commonly evident on its outer layer.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Fibers:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Extrinsic fibers</strong> are the Sharpey's fibers from the PDL that insert <em>into</em> the cementum perpendicularly to provide tooth attachment.</li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic fibers</strong> are produced by cementoblasts and are part of the cementum matrix itself. They run <em>parallel</em> to the root surface and do not contribute to attachment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cellular Intrinsic Fiber Cementum (CIFC):</strong> This type of cementum is involved in repair and adaptation. It is found in apical and furcation areas.</li>
<li><strong>Cementoid Layer:</strong> The outer surface of actively forming cementum, including CIFC, is covered by a thin, unmineralized organic matrix called <strong>cementoid</strong>. This is analogous to the osteoid layer on bone. Therefore, statement E is correct.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 26:</h3>
<p>During the final steps of irrigation of the root canal treatment of tooth #14, the patient suddenly experienced severe pain and a swelling developed on the labial vestibule of #14. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Seal the tooth using MTA.</li>
<li><strong>B. Irrigate the canal with a large amount of saline.</strong></li>
<li>C. Inject non-setting calcium hydroxide into the canal and temporize the tooth.</li>
<li>D. Extract the tooth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The sudden onset of severe pain and rapid swelling during irrigation is the classic presentation of a <strong>sodium hypochlorite accident</strong>, where the irrigant has been extruded past the apex into the periapical tissues.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate Management:</strong> The first and most critical step is to immediately attempt to dilute and flush out the caustic hypochlorite from the tissues. This is achieved by <strong>irrigating the canal with a large volume of sterile saline</strong>. This helps to neutralize the irrigant and reduce the severity of the subsequent tissue necrosis and inflammation. After irrigation, analgesics and antibiotics are prescribed, and the patient is monitored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 27:</h3>
<p>A patient presents for cementation of a CAD/CAM restoration. The restoration is unstable in the patient's mouth but stable on the cast. Which of the following is the most likely reason?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Inaccurate digital impression</strong></li>
<li>B. Sharp line angles in the tooth preparation</li>
<li>C. Undercuts in the tooth preparation</li>
<li>D. Open proximal contacts in the provisional restoration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The core of the problem is a <strong>discrepancy between the model and the actual tooth</strong>. If the restoration fits the model perfectly but not the tooth, it means the model is not an accurate replica of the tooth.</li>
<li>The model is generated from the digital scan. Therefore, an error in the scan – an <strong>inaccurate digital impression</strong> where part of the preparation was not captured correctly – is the only logical cause.</li>
<li><strong>Other Options:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Sharp line angles</strong> would cause overmilling, and the crown would be loose on <em>both</em> the model and the tooth.</li>
<li><strong>Open contacts in the provisional</strong> would cause adjacent teeth to drift, resulting in tight proximal contacts on the final crown, preventing it from seating fully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 28:</h3>
<p>While preparing the middle third of the mesiobuccal canal of tooth #36 during root canal treatment, the working length could no longer be reached. Which of the following is the most likely reason?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. The dentist did not recapitulate after every file.</li>
<li>B. The dentist did not irrigate after every file.</li>
<li><strong>C. A ledge was accidentally created within the canal.</strong></li>
<li>D. The file separated in the canal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of working length can be caused by debris packing in the apical third (due to lack of irrigation/recapitulation) or by iatrogenic errors.</li>
<li>The key detail here is that the blockage occurred in the <strong>middle third</strong> of the canal.</li>
<li>Packing of dentinal debris (from options A and B) almost always occurs in the <strong>apical third</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>ledge</strong> is an artificial irregularity created on the canal wall, typically at the point of a curvature. If the canal has a curvature in its middle third, it is highly likely that an instrument has created a ledge, which is now preventing subsequent files from advancing past that point to the apex.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 29:</h3>
<p>What is the crown height space needed for an implant-retained removable partial denture?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Less than 8 mm</li>
<li>B. 8-12 mm</li>
<li><strong>C. More than 12 mm</strong></li>
<li>D. The crown height space does not differ based on the prosthesis type.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crown Height Space:</strong> The vertical distance from the crest of the alveolar bone to the occlusal plane of the opposing teeth.</li>
<li>Different restorations require different amounts of vertical space.</li>
<li><strong>Implant-Retained Removable Dentures</strong> require the <em>most</em> crown height space. This is because you must accommodate the height of the denture acrylic base, the denture teeth, and, most importantly, the attachment system (e.g., a bar, locators, ball abutments) that connects the denture to the implants.</li>
<li>The minimum required space is generally considered to be <strong>more than 12 mm</strong>. A fixed implant prosthesis typically requires 8-12 mm.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 30:</h3>
<p>A tooth has symptoms of pulpitis and a pulp exposure. Which of the following factors is most important in determining the treatment of choice?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Time since the pulp exposure occurred</li>
<li>B. The size of the pulp exposure</li>
<li>C. The type of the pulp exposure</li>
<li><strong>D. The amount of bleeding from the exposed pulp</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While all the factors listed can influence the prognosis, the most critical determinant of the immediate treatment plan is the status of the pulp tissue, which is assessed clinically by hemorrhage control.</li>
<li>The <strong>amount of bleeding</strong> from the pulp after exposure or amputation is a direct indicator of the extent of pulpal inflammation.</li>
<li>If hemostasis (the stopping of bleeding) can be achieved quickly and easily (e.g., within 5-10 minutes) after removing the coronal pulp, it suggests the remaining radicular pulp is healthy, and a pulpotomy is likely to succeed.</li>
<li>If bleeding is profuse and cannot be controlled, it indicates that the inflammation extends deep into the radicular pulp, and a pulpectomy (complete removal of the pulp) is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 61:</h3>
<p>An 18-year-old patient, previously diagnosed with necrotizing gingivitis, returns to the dental clinic six weeks after initial treatment, which included debridement, antibiotics, and improved oral hygiene. The patient reports no pain but expresses concern about the irregular and unaesthetic contour of the gingiva, particularly in the anterior region. On examination, there is no evidence of active infection or inflammation, but the gingival margins are uneven and cratered. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to address the patient's concern?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Observe and re-evaluate in 4-6 weeks.</li>
<li>B. Repeat debridement and re-evaluate in 4-6 weeks.</li>
<li>C. Instruct the patient to take a new course of antibiotics.</li>
<li><strong>D. Perform gingivectomy or gingivoplasty.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Necrotizing periodontal diseases cause rapid tissue destruction, characteristically leading to "punched-out" or cratered interdental papillae and uneven gingival margins.</li>
<li>After the acute infection has resolved (as in this case), these architectural defects remain. The patient's concern is purely aesthetic and related to the poor contour of the healed gingiva.</li>
<li><strong>Gingivoplasty</strong> is a surgical procedure specifically designed to reshape the gingiva to create a more physiological and aesthetic contour. Gingivectomy (excision of gingiva) may be part of this process. This is the correct procedure to address the patient's chief complaint.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 62:</h3>
<p>Which of the following may lead to apex locator reading errors?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. External root resorption</li>
<li>B. Internal root resorption</li>
<li><strong>C. Calcified canals</strong></li>
<li>D. Pulp necrosis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic apex locators work by measuring the difference in electrical impedance between the file in the canal and an electrode on the patient's lip.</li>
<li><strong>Calcified Canals:</strong> A heavily calcified or blocked canal can impede the flow of the electrical current, preventing it from reaching the apex and completing the circuit properly. This can lead to erratic or inaccurate readings.</li>
<li><strong>Other Factors:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Pulp Necrosis:</strong> Does not affect accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>External/Internal Resorption:</strong> Studies have shown these do not significantly affect the accuracy of modern apex locators.</li>
<li><strong>Other causes of errors:</strong> Contact with metallic restorations, an open apex in an immature tooth, or severe hemorrhage/exudate in the canal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 63:</h3>
<p>A 60-year-old patient presented to the clinic with a purple-red lesion on the hard palate. The patient mentioned that he was diagnosed with HIV two years ago. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this lesion?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Antiretroviral therapy</strong></li>
<li>B. Intralesional corticosteroids</li>
<li>C. Surgical excision with 5 mm margins</li>
<li>D. Systemic antibiotic therapy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> A purple-red lesion on the palate of an HIV-positive patient is classic for <strong>Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)</strong>, an AIDS-defining malignancy caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> While localized lesions can be treated with surgery or intralesional chemotherapy, the most significant and effective treatment for AIDS-related KS is systemic <strong>Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> HAART suppresses the HIV virus, which allows the patient's immune system (specifically their CD4 T-cell count) to recover. This restored immune function is then able to control the HHV-8 virus, often leading to the regression or complete resolution of the KS lesions without direct chemotherapy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 64:</h3>
<p>For management of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, administration of systemic antivirals will produce resolution of symptoms if administered within:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. The first day of symptoms</li>
<li><strong>B. The first three symptomatic days</strong></li>
<li>C. The first five symptomatic days</li>
<li>D. At any time during the course of the disease</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is the initial infection with the Herpes Simplex Virus.</li>
<li>While treatment is often palliative (analgesics, fluids), systemic antiviral medication like acyclovir can shorten the duration and lessen the severity of the illness.</li>
<li>However, for the antiviral to be effective, it must be initiated early in the course of the infection while the virus is actively replicating. The clinical window of opportunity is within the <strong>first 72 hours (three days)</strong> of the onset of symptoms. After this period, the medication provides little to no benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 65:</h3>
<p>A patient presents for orthodontic treatment. Intraoral and extraoral examination reveals a dental Class III malocclusion and crowding in the mandibular arch. In order to create space for tooth alignment, which teeth should be extracted?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Mandibular first premolars</strong></li>
<li>B. Mandibular second premolars</li>
<li>C. Maxillary first premolars</li>
<li>D. Maxillary second premolars</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The question asks for the extraction choice to specifically <strong>create space for tooth alignment</strong> due to crowding. The crowding is in the mandibular arch.</li>
<li>To relieve anterior crowding, the standard choice is to extract the <strong>first premolars</strong>. This places the extraction space closest to the area of crowding (incisors and canines), allowing for efficient retraction and alignment of these teeth.</li>
<li>Extracting the second premolars is typically done to facilitate mesialization of the molars (e.g., to correct a Class II molar relationship), not to resolve anterior crowding. Extracting maxillary teeth would not resolve crowding in the mandibular arch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 66:</h3>
<p>During a pulpotomy procedure on tooth #84, an iatrogenic perforation was produced in the floor of the pulp chamber. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of tooth #84?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Immediate seal of the perforation</li>
<li>B. Delayed seal of the perforation</li>
<li>C. Immediate surgical repair of the perforation</li>
<li><strong>D. Extraction of tooth #84</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While a furcation perforation in a permanent tooth is often repaired with a material like MTA, the prognosis for repairing such a perforation in a <strong>primary tooth</strong> is very poor.</li>
<li>The area is difficult to seal effectively, and the process of physiologic root resorption can be disrupted, leading to chronic inflammation and potential damage to the developing permanent tooth bud underneath.</li>
<li>Therefore, the generally accepted standard of care when a furcation perforation occurs in a primary molar is <strong>extraction</strong> of the tooth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 67:</h3>
<p>Radiographic examination of an implant revealed a 5 mm vertical bone defect on the mesial, with no mobility and no pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR)</li>
<li><strong>B. Guided bone regeneration (GBR)</strong></li>
<li>C. Continue with follow-up and do nothing.</li>
<li>D. Remove the implant as it is deemed a failed implant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> A vertical bone defect around an implant indicates peri-implantitis. Even though it is currently asymptomatic and not mobile, leaving it untreated will lead to progressive bone loss and eventual implant failure. Therefore, treatment is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Goal:</strong> The goal is to regenerate the lost bone in the defect. This is accomplished by raising a flap, debriding the implant surface, placing a bone graft material into the defect, and covering it with a barrier membrane.</li>
<li><strong>Terminology:</strong> When this regenerative procedure is performed around a natural tooth to regenerate bone and PDL, it is called <strong>Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR)</strong>. When the same procedure is performed around a dental implant to regenerate only bone, it is called <strong>Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR)</strong>. Since this is an implant, GBR is the correct term and procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 68:</h3>
<p>A researcher has discovered a new drug that is used to treat gingivitis. Which of the following parameters is the most important to deem this drug effective?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Decreased level of plaque</li>
<li>B. Decreased level of bacteria in the oral cavity</li>
<li><strong>C. Decreased level of gingival bleeding on probing</strong></li>
<li>D. Reduction in probing depths</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to measure the clinical outcome of the disease being treated. Gingivitis is, by definition, inflammation of the gingiva.</li>
<li>The most objective and universally accepted clinical sign of gingival inflammation is <strong>bleeding on probing (BOP)</strong>.</li>
<li>Therefore, a significant reduction in BOP would be the primary endpoint and the most important parameter to demonstrate that the drug is effectively treating the gingivitis (i.e., reducing the inflammation). A reduction in plaque levels measures the cause, not the disease state itself. A reduction in probing depth is a measure for periodontitis, not gingivitis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 69:</h3>
<p>Which of the following impression techniques is most accurate for an implant?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Open tray implant level impression</strong></li>
<li>B. Closed tray implant level impression</li>
<li>C. Open tray abutment level impression</li>
<li>D. Closed tray abutment level impression</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implant Level vs. Abutment Level:</strong> An <strong>implant-level</strong> impression, where the impression coping attaches directly to the implant fixture, is more accurate than an abutment-level impression. It eliminates a potential source of error from an ill-fitting abutment.</li>
<li><strong>Open Tray vs. Closed Tray:</strong> An <strong>open-tray</strong> impression is more accurate than a closed-tray impression. In an open-tray technique, the impression copings are unscrewed and remain locked inside the impression material when it is removed from the mouth. This eliminates the risk of error that occurs in the closed-tray technique when the clinician must manually remove the copings from the mouth and try to precisely reposition them back into the set impression material.</li>
<li>Combining these factors, the open tray, implant-level technique is the most accurate method.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 70:</h3>
<p>A 29-year-old patient presented to the clinic with multiple papules and pustules around the vermilion border of the upper and lower lips. The patient mentioned that the lesions have been present for the last two months. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Exfoliative cheilitis</li>
<li><strong>B. Perioral dermatitis</strong></li>
<li>C. Angular cheilitis</li>
<li>D. Recurrent herpes simplex</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The description of multiple small <strong>papules and pustules</strong> in the perioral skin (around the mouth), often with a characteristic sparing of the area immediately adjacent to the vermilion border, is the classic clinical presentation of <strong>perioral dermatitis</strong>.</li>
<li>It is an inflammatory skin condition often triggered by topical steroids or heavy cosmetics.</li>
<li>The other conditions present differently: Exfoliative cheilitis is scaling and crusting of the lips themselves; Angular cheilitis is at the corners of the mouth; Recurrent herpes presents as localized vesicles that ulcerate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 71:</h3>
<p>You are treating a patient with no significant medical history. During the appointment, the patient complains of a sudden severe pain in his chest. Which of the following is the most important emergency management consideration?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Administer oxygen and monitor the patient's vital signs.</li>
<li>B. Administer nitroglycerin and monitor the patient's vital signs.</li>
<li>C. Administer salbutamol and monitor the patient's vital signs.</li>
<li><strong>D. Activate emergency medical services.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Any <strong>first-time occurrence of severe chest pain</strong> in an adult must be treated as a <strong>myocardial infarction (MI)</strong> until proven otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> An MI is a life-threatening medical emergency. The single most important action and the absolute first priority is to <strong>activate emergency medical services (call 911)</strong> to get the patient to a hospital as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>While administering oxygen, nitroglycerin, and aspirin are all part of the MONA protocol for MI, none of these should delay activating the emergency response system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 72:</h3>
<p>A maxillary complete denture is realigned, and during the delivery appointment, it is noted that the patient's face appears elongated and the maxillary incisors are showing excessive display. Which of the following is the most likely cause?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Excessive removal of acrylic from the fitting surface of the denture prior to the reline impression.</li>
<li><strong>B. Insufficient venting of the impression material during the impression-taking step.</strong></li>
<li>C. The dentist applied excessive pressure while seating the denture during the impression.</li>
<li>D. The insufficient viscosity of the impression material that was used during the impression-taking step.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> An elongated face and excessive incisor display are classic signs of an <strong>increased vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Cause:</strong> This error occurred during the reline impression. An increased VDO means the denture was not fully seated on the residual ridge when the impression was made.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> If the impression material cannot escape easily from under the denture, it becomes hydraulically trapped and prevents the denture from seating completely. This is why <strong>insufficient venting</strong> (not drilling escape holes in the denture) is a primary cause of this error. Insufficient pressure, using a high-viscosity material, or not removing enough acrylic could also cause this, but insufficient venting is a direct cause of the hydraulic pressure buildup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 73:</h3>
<p>What is the mechanism of action of metformin?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. It reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis.</strong></li>
<li>B. It increases the sensitivity of target tissues to insulin.</li>
<li>C. It targets the beta cells in the pancreas to stimulate insulin release.</li>
<li>D. It decreases the absorption of saccharides in the intestine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Metformin is a first-line oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class.</li>
<li>Its <strong>primary mechanism of action</strong> is to decrease the production of glucose by the liver, a process known as <strong>hepatic gluconeogenesis</strong>.</li>
<li>While it does have a minor effect on increasing the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues (Option B), its main effect is on the liver.</li>
<li>Option C describes sulfonylureas, and Option D describes alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 74:</h3>
<p>Which of the following types of bone grafts decreases the success rate of an implant surgery with sinus lifting?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Block autograft</strong></li>
<li>B. Particulate autograft</li>
<li>C. Particulate allograft</li>
<li>D. Particulate xenograft</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A sinus lift procedure involves augmenting the sinus floor to create vertical bone height. This requires a graft material that can be packed into the space and will be readily vascularized and remodeled into new bone.</li>
<li><strong>Particulate Grafts</strong> (small granules of bone) are ideal for this. They have a large surface area, allowing for rapid invasion by blood vessels and bone-forming cells.</li>
<li><strong>Block Grafts</strong> (solid blocks of cortical bone) are poorly suited for sinus augmentation. They are dense, have poor vascularity, and do not integrate well in this environment. They are more likely to become necrotic and fail, thus decreasing the success rate. Block grafts are better used for onlay grafting to provide structural support where needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 75:</h3>
<p>Tooth #14 has a 3 mm probing depth on the mesial and 4 mm of recession. What is the best oral hygiene method to clean this site?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Interproximal brush</strong></li>
<li>B. Dental floss</li>
<li>C. Toothpick</li>
<li>D. Rubber tip</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The patient has a total of 7 mm of clinical attachment loss (3 mm pocket + 4 mm recession) on the mesial of the maxillary first premolar.</li>
<li>This significant attachment loss results in a large, open interdental embrasure space (a "black triangle").</li>
<li>Furthermore, the maxillary first premolar has a distinct developmental concavity on its mesial root surface.</li>
<li><strong>Dental floss</strong> is ineffective in these situations because it is a thin string that will span across the concavity and cannot adequately debride the root surface or fill the large embrasure.</li>
<li>An <strong>interproximal brush</strong> is the ideal tool. Its bristles can adapt to the root concavity and effectively clean the large surface area within the open embrasure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 76:</h3>
<p>A seven-year-old patient presents with the permanent first molar erupting, but its mesial side is blocked under the primary second molar. Radiographic examination reveals resorption of the distal side of the primary second molar reaching the inner third of dentin. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Observation for three months</li>
<li><strong>B. Extraction of the primary second molar</strong></li>
<li>C. Surgical exposure of the mesial side of the permanent first molar</li>
<li>D. Placement of a Nance appliance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> This is a case of <strong>severe ectopic eruption</strong> of the first permanent molar. The severity is indicated by the extensive resorption of the primary molar root.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> In severe cases where the permanent molar is significantly impacted and has caused irreversible damage to the primary molar, correction with an appliance is no longer feasible. The compromised primary second molar must be <strong>extracted</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Next Step (Implied):</strong> After extraction, there will be a significant space deficiency. The next step would be to implement a <strong>space-regaining</strong> appliance (e.g., a Nance with a spring, or a distalizing appliance) to push the permanent molar back into its correct position before the premolar erupts. Simple observation (A) or a passive Nance appliance (D) would allow the space loss to worsen.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 77:</h3>
<p>A healing abutment has been placed on an implant prior to restoration. The patient returns for his appointment two weeks later, and the gingiva has overgrown on top of the healing abutment. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Use a wider healing abutment.</li>
<li><strong>B. Use a longer healing abutment.</strong></li>
<li>C. Contour the bone.</li>
<li>D. Perform a gingivectomy on the mesial side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of a healing abutment is to shape the soft tissue and keep it from growing over the top of the implant fixture.</li>
<li>If the gingiva has overgrown the abutment, it means the abutment that was placed was <strong>too short</strong> for the thickness of the patient's tissue.</li>
<li>The correct management is to remove the short healing abutment, remove the excess tissue if necessary, and place a <strong>longer healing abutment</strong> that extends at least 1-1.5 mm above the gingival margin. This will prevent the tissue from overgrowing it again. Using a wider abutment addresses a different issue (emergence profile) and would not solve the overgrowth problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 78:</h3>
<p>During the try-in of a posterior zirconia crown on tooth #46, it showed adequate marginal fit and was fully seated onto the prepared tooth, but no occlusal contact with the opposing tooth was observed. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the infraocclusion?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Debris present on the adjacent teeth during impression making.</li>
<li>B. Debris present on the surface of the crown preparation during impression taking.</li>
<li><strong>C. Debris present on the surface of the opposing tooth during the maxillary arch impression.</strong></li>
<li>D. The technician over-milled the occlusal surface of the crown.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The crown is in infraocclusion, meaning it is too short.</li>
<li><strong>The Cause:</strong> This error occurred during the fabrication steps. If there was debris (e.g., a piece of temporary cement) on the occlusal surface of the <strong>opposing tooth</strong> when the impression or scan was taken, the laboratory technician would fabricate the crown to occlude with that artificially high surface.</li>
<li>When the patient returns for the try-in, the debris is gone from the opposing tooth. Now, the crown, which was made to fit this "higher" opposing tooth, is too short and does not make contact. This results in infraocclusion.</li>
<li>Debris on the prepared tooth would prevent the crown from seating. Debris on adjacent teeth would affect proximal contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 79:</h3>
<p>A 14-year-old patient requires retraction of the maxillary anterior segment following first premolar extractions. The orthodontist decides to place temporary anchorage devices (TADs) in the infrazygomatic crest to prevent mesial movement of the posterior teeth. This approach is an example of which type of anchorage?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Cortical anchorage</li>
<li><strong>B. Skeletal anchorage</strong></li>
<li>C. Reinforced anchorage</li>
<li>D. Reciprocal anchorage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anchorage</strong> in orthodontics refers to resistance to unwanted tooth movement.</li>
<li><strong>Skeletal Anchorage:</strong> This is a method that uses the bone itself as the anchor point, completely bypassing the teeth. Temporary anchorage devices (TADs), also known as mini-screws or mini-implants, are placed directly into the bone (like the infrazygomatic crest or the palate).</li>
<li>Forces are then applied from the TADs to the teeth that need to be moved. Because the TAD is osseointegrated and does not move, it provides <strong>absolute anchorage</strong>, allowing for tooth movement without any unwanted reciprocal movement of the anchor unit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 80:</h3>
<p>Which of the following factors will increase the risk of cyclic fatigue failure in rotary endodontic instruments?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Uniform taper</li>
<li><strong>B. Increased depth of cutting flutes</strong></li>
<li>C. Small size</li>
<li>D. Low taper (e.g., 2%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyclic Fatigue</strong> is the failure of a metal due to repeated cycles of tension and compression, which occurs when a file rotates within a curved canal.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Depth of Cutting Flutes:</strong> Deeper flutes mean there is less solid metal in the cross-section of the instrument at any given point. This reduction in the cross-sectional diameter makes the instrument weaker and more susceptible to breaking from cyclic fatigue.</li>
<li>The other options decrease the risk of fracture:<ul>
<li><strong>Small size and low taper</strong> make the instrument more flexible and resistant to fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Uniform taper</strong> provides more even stress distribution compared to a variable taper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 81:</h3>
<p>Which of the following groups of antibiotics demonstrate a bacteriostatic effect?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Carbapenems</li>
<li><strong>B. Macrolides</strong></li>
<li>C. Aminoglycosides</li>
<li>D. Cephalosporins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Antibiotics are classified as either bactericidal (they kill bacteria) or bacteriostatic (they inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction, allowing the host's immune system to clear the infection).</li>
<li><strong>Bacteriostatic:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Macrolides</strong> (e.g., Erythromycin, Clarithromycin, Azithromycin)</li>
<li>Tetracyclines</li>
<li>Clindamycin</li>
<li>Sulfonamides</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bactericidal:</strong><ul>
<li>Beta-lactams (Penicillins, <strong>Cephalosporins, Carbapenems</strong>)</li>
<li>Vancomycin</li>
<li>Metronidazole</li>
<li>Fluoroquinolones</li>
<li><strong>Aminoglycosides</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 82:</h3>
<p>When fabricating a removable partial denture, which of the following factors would indicate the use of a wrought wire clasp instead of a cast clasp?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. A clasp on terminal abutment teeth in Kennedy Class I dentures.</li>
<li>B. A clasp on the distal abutment tooth in a Kennedy Class III denture.</li>
<li>C. A clasp on an abutment tooth with a shallow undercut.</li>
<li><strong>D. A clasp on an abutment tooth which has slight mobility and compromised periodontal attachment.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The key difference between a wrought wire clasp and a cast clasp is <strong>flexibility</strong>. Wrought wire is much more flexible than cast metal.</li>
<li>A <strong>cast clasp</strong> is rigid and transmits significant stress to the abutment tooth during insertion and removal. This is detrimental to a tooth that is already periodontally compromised.</li>
<li>A <strong>wrought wire clasp</strong>, due to its flexibility, engages the undercut with much less force, reducing the stress transferred to a mobile or periodontally weak abutment tooth. It is also preferred for deep undercuts and in aesthetic zones.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 83:</h3>
<p>For pediatric patients, what is the appropriate dose and concentration of epinephrine to be administered in case of anaphylaxis using an EpiPen Jr.?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. 0.3 mg of a 1:1000 solution</li>
<li><strong>B. 0.15 mg of a 1:2000 solution</strong></li>
<li>C. 0.5 mg of a 1:1000 solution</li>
<li>D. 0.15 mg of a 1:1000 solution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are two standard autoinjector doses for epinephrine:<ul>
<li><strong>EpiPen (Adult):</strong> Delivers <strong>0.3 mg</strong> of epinephrine in a <strong>1:1000</strong> concentration.</li>
<li><strong>EpiPen Jr. (Pediatric):</strong> Delivers <strong>0.15 mg</strong> (half the adult dose) of epinephrine in a <strong>1:2000</strong> concentration (half the adult concentration).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The EpiPen Jr. is intended for children weighing between 15 kg and 30 kg (33-66 lbs).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 84:</h3>
<p>Which of the following drugs has the lowest opioid agonist efficacy?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Codeine</li>
<li><strong>B. Pentazocine</strong></li>
<li>C. Methadone</li>
<li>D. Fentanyl</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficacy</strong> refers to the maximum effect a drug can produce. Opioids are compared based on their ability to produce analgesia relative to morphine.</li>
<li>Codeine, Methadone, and Fentanyl are all <strong>full agonists</strong> at the mu-opioid receptor, meaning they produce a strong analgesic effect. Fentanyl is extremely potent.</li>
<li><strong>Pentazocine</strong> is a <strong>mixed agonist-antagonist</strong>. It is an agonist at kappa receptors but a weak antagonist at mu receptors. This mixed profile results in a much lower maximal analgesic effect (lower efficacy) compared to full agonists and also creates a "ceiling effect" where increasing the dose does not increase the analgesia.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 85:</h3>
<p>During a dental appointment, your patient starts experiencing a sudden headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, and muscle weakness on the right side of his face. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Activate emergency medical services and administer nitroglycerin, aspirin, and oxygen.</li>
<li><strong>B. Activate emergency medical services and administer oxygen.</strong></li>
<li>C. Activate emergency medical services and administer epinephrine.</li>
<li>D. Administer oxygen and keep the patient under observation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The constellation of sudden neurological symptoms (headache, dizziness, visual changes, and unilateral facial weakness) is a classic presentation of a <strong>cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or stroke</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> A stroke is a time-critical medical emergency.<ol>
<li>The absolute first priority is to <strong>activate EMS (call 911)</strong>.</li>
<li>The patient should be kept comfortable, and <strong>oxygen can be administered</strong> if they are hypoxic.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It is critical <strong>NOT</strong> to administer aspirin or any other anticoagulant (Option A) because you do not know if the stroke is ischemic (caused by a clot) or hemorrhagic (caused by a bleed). Giving aspirin during a hemorrhagic stroke would be catastrophic. This differentiation can only be made with a CT scan at the hospital.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 86:</h3>
<p>Which of the following types of root resorption may be associated with in-office internal bleaching?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Surface resorption</li>
<li><strong>B. External cervical resorption</strong></li>
<li>C. Apical resorption</li>
<li>D. Internal resorption</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A known, though rare, complication of internal bleaching (both walking bleach and in-office techniques) is the development of <strong>external cervical resorption</strong>.</li>
<li>The theory is that the bleaching agent (hydrogen peroxide) can leak through patent dentinal tubules in the cervical area, below the CEJ, where the enamel is thin or absent. This leakage into the periodontal ligament space can trigger an inflammatory response that leads to clastic cells resorbing the external root surface in the cervical region. This is why placing a protective base over the gutta-percha at the level of the CEJ is a critical step in the internal bleaching procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 87:</h3>
<p>Which of the following muscles will contribute most to the displacement of a mandibular complete denture in a patient who has severe alveolar ridge resorption?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Medial pterygoid muscle</li>
<li>B. Buccinator muscle</li>
<li>C. Masseter muscle</li>
<li><strong>D. Mylohyoid muscle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the mandibular ridge resorbs, the attachments of the muscles on the floor of the mouth become effectively higher and closer to the crest of the ridge.</li>
<li>The <strong>mylohyoid muscle</strong> forms the entire muscular floor of the mouth. When the patient swallows or lifts their tongue, the mylohyoid muscle contracts and elevates.</li>
<li>In a severely resorbed mandible, this upward movement of the muscle will directly lift and dislodge the lingual flange of the denture, making it the primary muscle responsible for instability. While the masseter can affect the distobuccal flange, the influence of the mylohyoid along the entire lingual border is more significant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 88:</h3>
<p>A complete denture wearer presents to the clinic complaining that he recently started to feel pain under his upper complete denture. Examination reveals an ulcerated palatal torus. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Relieve the fitting surface of the upper denture.</strong></li>
<li>B. Surgical removal of the torus.</li>
<li>C. Surgical removal of the torus and fabrication of a new denture.</li>
<li>D. Incisional biopsy of the ulcer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The problem is that the denture is putting excessive pressure on the thin mucosa covering the bony palatal torus, causing a pressure sore or ulcer.</li>
<li>The simplest, most conservative, and correct initial management is to <strong>relieve the intaglio (fitting) surface of the denture</strong> in the area that corresponds to the torus.</li>
<li>This can be done chairside using a pressure-indicating paste to identify the exact spot and an acrylic bur to gently grind away the denture base material. This eliminates the pressure point and allows the ulcer to heal. Surgical removal of the torus is a much more invasive option and is not the first line of treatment for a simple pressure spot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 89:</h3>
<p>During orthodontic treatment of a young patient with rounded anterior teeth, a black triangle was observed in the midline. This could be due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. The central incisors have a rectangular shape.</li>
<li><strong>B. Flaring of the roots of the central incisors.</strong></li>
<li>C. Excessive interproximal stripping of the central incisors.</li>
<li>D. Attachment loss due to periodontal disease.</li>
<li>E. The proximal contact between the central incisors is too gingival.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A "black triangle" is an open gingival embrasure space that appears when the interdental papilla does not fully fill the area below the contact point.</li>
<li>The position of the papilla is determined by the underlying bone and the position of the contact point. The further the contact point is from the bone crest, the more likely a black triangle will form.</li>
<li><strong>Flaring of the roots</strong> means the roots are angled divergently away from each other, while the crowns are angled convergently toward each other. This pushes the <strong>contact point very high up incisally</strong>. This large distance between the incisal contact and the gingiva creates a large embrasure space that the papilla cannot fill, resulting in a black triangle. Rectangular teeth or a gingivally placed contact would do the opposite and reduce the embrasure space.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 90:</h3>
<p>A 17-year-old patient presents for follow-up six months after a luxation injury to his maxillary central incisor. Tooth mobility is normal, and the periapical radiograph shows calcific obliteration of the root canal space. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Keep the tooth under observation.</strong></li>
<li>B. Non-surgical endodontic treatment.</li>
<li>C. Apicectomy.</li>
<li>D. Partial pulpotomy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Calcific obliteration (or pulp canal obliteration) is a common response to dental trauma. It occurs when the pulp, in response to the injury, rapidly lays down reparative/tertiary dentin, which gradually fills up the pulp chamber and canal space.</li>
<li><strong>Sign of Vitality:</strong> The fact that the tooth is forming new dentin is a definitive sign that the <strong>pulp is vital</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> As long as the tooth remains vital and asymptomatic and shows no signs of periapical pathology, <strong>no treatment is indicated</strong>. The tooth should simply be monitored periodically (e.g., annually) with pulp testing and radiographs. Endodontic treatment is only initiated if the tooth eventually becomes necrotic and develops a periapical lesion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 91:</h3>
<p>A patient attends the clinic for crown preparation on tooth #36, which was endodontically treated six months ago. The patient mentions that she has occasional discomfort from that tooth when eating, and the tooth is tender to percussion. A periapical radiograph reveals acceptable obturation in the root canals and a radiolucency associated with the apex of the mesial root. What is the most appropriate next step?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Prescribe antibiotics for one week and follow-up.</li>
<li>B. Carry out crown preparation and restore with a temporary crown until the symptoms resolve.</li>
<li><strong>C. Take a cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan.</strong></li>
<li>D. Initiate endodontic retreatment.</li>
<li>E. Carry out an apicectomy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The patient has signs and symptoms of a failing root canal (tenderness to percussion, discomfort on biting, periapical radiolucency) six months after treatment.</li>
<li><strong>The Dilemma:</strong> The cause of the failure is not apparent on the 2D periapical radiograph, which shows "acceptable obturation." This suggests a more complex issue, such as a missed canal (e.g., a mid-mesial canal), a vertical root fracture, or complex apical anatomy.</li>
<li><strong>The Next Step:</strong> Before proceeding with any treatment (retreatment or surgery), the cause of the failure must be identified. A <strong>cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan</strong> provides a 3D view of the tooth and is the ideal diagnostic tool to identify these complex anatomical reasons for endodontic failure that are not visible on a conventional radiograph.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 92:</h3>
<p>Which of the following increases the bond strength in the hybrid layer in the one-step self-etching technique?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Treat the enamel with an abrasive prior to using the self-etching adhesive.</li>
<li><strong>B. Rub multiple layers of adhesive on the dentin.</strong></li>
<li>C. Apply phosphoric acid etch to the tooth.</li>
<li>D. Apply hydrofluoric acid etch to the tooth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The question specifically asks how to improve the bond strength of the <strong>hybrid layer</strong>, which forms in the <strong>dentin</strong>.</li>
<li>One-step self-etch adhesives are known for creating a relatively thin hybrid layer.</li>
<li>Studies have shown that actively <strong>rubbing or agitating multiple coats</strong> of the adhesive onto the dentin surface improves the infiltration of the resin monomers into the demineralized collagen network. This creates a thicker, more robust, and better-quality hybrid layer, thus increasing the bond strength to dentin.</li>
<li>Applying phosphoric acid (Option C) improves the bond to <em>enamel</em> by creating deeper etch patterns, but it does not improve the hybrid layer in dentin; in fact, it can over-etch dentin if used improperly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 93:</h3>
<p>Which of the following would classify a two-year-old patient as being at high risk for caries?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Primary caregiver with multiple restorations.</li>
<li><strong>B. Nocturnal breastfeeding.</strong></li>
<li>C. Increased lactobacilli count.</li>
<li>D. Consumption of 4 oz of juice per day.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) has caries risk assessment tools that identify key risk factors.</li>
<li><strong>Nocturnal Breastfeeding/Bottle-feeding:</strong> Frequent, at-will breastfeeding or bottle-feeding at night after the eruption of teeth is a significant high-risk factor. During sleep, salivary flow decreases dramatically, so the milk (which contains sugars) pools around the teeth for prolonged periods, leading to aggressive early childhood caries.</li>
<li>The number of restorations in a caregiver is not a direct risk factor; <em>active caries</em> in the caregiver is. The frequency of sugar exposure is more important than the specific volume (Option D).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 94:</h3>
<p>Which of the following best characterizes the mechanical difference between uncontrolled tipping and bodily movement of a tooth during orthodontic treatment?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Uncontrolled tipping results in uniform displacement of the crown and root.</li>
<li>B. Bodily movement requires less force than tipping.</li>
<li><strong>C. Bodily movement involves translation of the crown and the root in the same direction and magnitude.</strong></li>
<li>D. Tipping generates forces primarily at the apex of the root.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tipping:</strong> This is the simplest form of tooth movement, where a single force is applied to the crown. The tooth rotates around a center of resistance, causing the crown to move in one direction and the root apex to move in the opposite direction.</li>
<li><strong>Bodily Movement (Translation):</strong> This is when the entire tooth—both the crown and the root—moves in the same direction by the same amount, without any tipping or rotation. It requires the application of both a force and a "couple" (a moment) to control the root position and is a much more complex and controlled movement than simple tipping.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 95:</h3>
<p>Which of the following best characterizes the histopathological appearance of Lichen Planus?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Non-keratinized epithelium with basal cell hyperplasia.</li>
<li>B. Acantholysis and intraepithelial clefting.</li>
<li><strong>C. A band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes at the epithelial-connective tissue interface.</strong></li>
<li>D. Granulomatous inflammation with Langerhans giant cells.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oral Lichen Planus is a chronic inflammatory condition with a very characteristic microscopic appearance.</li>
<li><strong>Key Histopathological Features:</strong><ol>
<li>Hyperkeratosis (which gives it the white appearance clinically).</li>
<li>Liquefactive degeneration of the basal cell layer of the epithelium.</li>
<li>A dense, <strong>"band-like" infiltrate of T-lymphocytes</strong> immediately beneath the epithelium, hugging the epithelial-connective tissue junction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Acantholysis (loss of cohesion between epithelial cells) is the hallmark of pemphigus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 96:</h3>
<p>A four-year-old patient presents with a unilateral posterior crossbite and midline deviation. On initial contact, an incisal interference is noticed between the right mandibular and maxillary primary canines, followed by a functional shift to the right into maximum intercuspation. Examination reveals that the maxillary arch width is adequate. What is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Maxillary expansion using a quad-helix appliance.</li>
<li>B. Maxillary expansion using a Hyrax appliance.</li>
<li>C. Extraction of the interfering primary canines.</li>
<li><strong>D. Selective occlusal adjustment of the interfering teeth.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The key finding is that the maxillary arch width is adequate and the crossbite is caused by a <strong>functional shift</strong> due to a <strong>canine interference</strong>. This is not a true skeletal crossbite. The patient's jaw shifts to the side to avoid the premature contact between the canines.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> Since the underlying skeletal structure is normal, the treatment is to simply eliminate the cause of the shift. This is done by performing a <strong>selective occlusal adjustment</strong> (selective grinding) on the interfering inclines of the primary canines. This removes the prematurity, allowing the mandible to close directly into a centered position without shifting, thereby correcting the crossbite. Expansion is not needed, and extraction is too aggressive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 97:</h3>
<p>When surveying a diagnostic cast for a removable partial denture design, which of the following is the purpose of tripoding the master cast?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It locates the height of contour.</li>
<li>B. It identifies the most retentive undercut areas.</li>
<li><strong>C. It allows the path of insertion to be reproduced on the surveyor.</strong></li>
<li>D. It assists in identifying guiding planes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After a dentist uses a surveyor to determine the most desirable path of insertion for a partial denture, they must have a way to record this specific orientation of the cast.</li>
<li><strong>Tripoding</strong> is the method used to do this. With the cast locked in its final tilted position on the surveyor, the vertical analyzing rod is locked at a fixed height. Three widely spaced marks are then made on the cast with the tip of the rod.</li>
<li>Later, if the cast is removed, it can be placed back on the surveyor, and the tilt can be adjusted until the tip of the vertical rod simultaneously touches all three marks. This guarantees that the cast has been returned to the exact same orientation, allowing the chosen <strong>path of insertion to be reproduced</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 98:</h3>
<p>Two days following crown cementation on tooth #36, a patient returned to the clinic complaining of pain on biting. Upon examination, tooth #36 has a positive response to cold testing. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Check the occlusion of the crown for high spots.</strong></li>
<li>B. Remove the crown and place a temporary crown.</li>
<li>C. Perform root canal treatment on tooth #36 through the crown.</li>
<li>D. Prescribe muscle relaxants and fabricate an occlusal splint.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The most common cause of pain on biting shortly after a new crown is cemented is a <strong>hyperocclusion</strong> or "high spot." The tooth is vital (positive cold test), so the issue is not pulpal. The pain is a result of occlusal trauma causing inflammation of the periodontal ligament.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> The first and most important step is to <strong>check the occlusion</strong> with articulating paper. If a high spot is identified, it should be carefully adjusted with a fine diamond bur until the occlusion is even and the patient is comfortable. This almost always resolves the symptom immediately. The other options are far too aggressive for this common and easily solved problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 99:</h3>
<p>Which of the following cytochrome P450 isoforms is most commonly involved in drug metabolism?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. CYP3A4</strong></li>
<li>B. CYP2D6</li>
<li>C. CYP2C8</li>
<li>D. CYP1A2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is a large family of enzymes primarily responsible for the metabolism of drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds in the liver.</li>
<li>While many isoforms exist, <strong>CYP3A4</strong> is by far the most abundant and most important isoform in humans. It is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 35-50% of all clinically used drugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 100:</h3>
<p>What is the maximum number of carpules of Articaine 4% with 1:200,000 epinephrine that can be given to a patient that weighs 35 kg?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. 2</li>
<li><strong>B. 3</strong></li>
<li>C. 4</li>
<li>D. 5</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 1: Calculate the Maximum Recommended Dose (MRD) in mg.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The MRD for Articaine is 7 mg/kg.</li>
<li>MRD = 7 mg/kg * 35 kg = <strong>245 mg</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 2: Calculate the amount of Articaine in one carpule.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 4% solution means 40 mg of drug per mL of solution.</li>
<li>A standard dental carpule contains 1.8 mL of solution.</li>
<li>mg per carpule = 40 mg/mL * 1.8 mL = <strong>72 mg</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of carpules.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Max carpules = Total MRD / mg per carpule</li>
<li>Max carpules = 245 mg / 72 mg/carpule = <strong>3.4 carpules</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 4: Round Down.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since you cannot give a fraction of a carpule, you must always round down to the nearest whole number to stay within the safe limit.</li>
<li>The maximum number of carpules is <strong>3</strong>.</li>
</ul>
