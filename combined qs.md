Here are day 1 questions.

### Question 1:
A 10-year-old child presents with migratory joint pain and swelling two weeks after recovering from a streptococcal pharyngitis. Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?
A. Direct damage by autoantibodies.
B. Direct streptococcal pyogenes infection of the joints.
C. Direct damage from exotoxins of the bacteria.
**D. Direct damage by antibodies that are produced against bacterial antigens.**

**Explanation:**
This condition is rheumatic fever, an autoimmune response triggered by a streptococcal infection.

*   The core mechanism is **molecular mimicry**. Antigens on the *Streptococcus pyogenes* bacteria are structurally similar to molecules on the surface of the host's own cells (e.g., in the heart, joints, and nervous system).
*   The body mounts an immune response, creating antibodies specifically against the bacterial antigens to clear the infection.
*   After the infection is resolved, these same antibodies mistakenly recognize and attack the body's own similar-looking cells, causing inflammation and damage in the joints, heart, etc.
*   **Option A is incorrect** because these are not true autoantibodies. True autoantibodies arise when the immune system loses tolerance and creates antibodies against self-antigens *without* a preceding foreign trigger like a bacterial infection. Here, the antibodies were initially and correctly formed against a foreign bacterium.
*   **Options B and C are incorrect** because the damage is not caused by a direct infection of the joints or by bacterial toxins. The damage is immune-mediated and occurs *after* the initial infection has been cleared.

### Question 2:
Which of the following implant sites would benefit the most from countersinking?
A. Posterior mandible.
B. Maxilla.
**C. Anterior mandible.**
D. Maxillary tuberosity.

**Explanation:**
Countersinking is a procedure where the coronal portion of an implant osteotomy is widened using a specific countersink drill.

*   **Purpose:** The coronal part of many implants is wider than the body. In very dense bone, this wider portion can encounter significant resistance, preventing the implant from seating fully to the bone crest level. Countersinking widens only this coronal part of the site to allow the implant to seat properly without excessive compression, which could lead to bone necrosis.
*   **Indication:** Countersinking is indicated specifically in areas with very dense cortical bone at the crest of the ridge.
*   **Correct Answer:** The **anterior mandible** is characterized by the densest bone in the oral cavity (D1 or D2 bone), which is primarily thick cortical bone. Therefore, it is the site that most often requires and benefits from countersinking.
*   **Incorrect Options:** The maxilla generally has more porous bone (D3/D4), and the posterior mandible is typically less dense than the anterior. These sites usually do not require countersinking as the bone is compressible enough to accommodate the implant.

### Question 3:
Following the initiation of warfarin therapy, which of the following clotting factors shows the most rapid decline in blood levels?
A. Factor II (Prothrombin)
**B. Factor VII**
C. Factor IX
D. Factor X

**Explanation:**
Warfarin is a Vitamin K antagonist, inhibiting the synthesis of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X). The factor that declines most rapidly determines how quickly the drug's effect can be measured.

*   The rate of decline depends on the **half-life** of each factor already present in the circulation.
*   **Factor VII** has the shortest half-life, at only **4-6 hours**.
*   The other factors have much longer half-lives: Factor IX (20-30 hours), Factor X (24-40 hours), and Factor II (60-72 hours).
*   Because it is cleared from the blood the fastest, Factor VII is the first factor to show a significant drop in levels after warfarin therapy begins.
*   This is why the Prothrombin Time (PT) / INR test, which is highly sensitive to levels of Factor VII (as it's in the extrinsic pathway), is used to monitor warfarin therapy.

---

### Question 4:
In which of the following cases is endodontic treatment likely to be most technically challenging?
A. A maxillary central incisor with a stone in the pulp chamber.
B. A maxillary premolar with two roots.
**C. A mandibular second molar with fused roots and torodontism.**
D. A mandibular first molar with three canals.

**Explanation:**
The difficulty of an endodontic case is determined by canal anatomy, morphology, and access.

*   **Correct Answer:** A mandibular second molar with fused roots and torodontism presents the greatest challenge.
    *   **Torodontism** means the pulp chamber is very large and apically displaced, making it difficult to locate the canal orifices, which are deep within the tooth.
    *   **Fused roots** in a mandibular second molar are highly indicative of a **C-shaped canal system**.
    *   C-shaped canals are notoriously difficult to debride, shape, and obturate due to their complex, ribbon-like anatomy with isthmuses and fins.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   A pulp stone (A) is a common and relatively simple obstruction to remove.
    *   A two-rooted maxillary premolar (B) is a normal, straightforward variation.
    *   A mandibular first molar with three canals (D) is the standard and most predictable case for a molar root canal.

### Question 5:
A 58-year-old patient with a history of myocardial infarction is taking daily low-dose aspirin as part of his prevention therapy. What is the primary mechanism by which aspirin reduces the risk of thrombotic events in these patients?
**A. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).**
B. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
C. Inhibition of prostaglandin E.
D. Inhibition of thrombin.

**Explanation:**
Aspirin's anti-thrombotic (antiplatelet) effect is achieved at low doses.

*   **Mechanism:** Low-dose aspirin **irreversibly inhibits the COX-1 enzyme** within platelets.
*   COX-1 is responsible for converting arachidonic acid into **Thromboxane A2 (TXA2)**.
*   TXA2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and, most importantly, a powerful promoter of platelet aggregation.
*   By blocking TXA2 synthesis, aspirin prevents platelets from clumping together, thus reducing the risk of forming a thrombus (blood clot).
*   The inhibition is **irreversible** because platelets lack a nucleus and cannot synthesize new COX-1 enzyme. The effect lasts for the entire lifespan of the platelet (7-10 days).
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   COX-2 inhibition (B) is related to aspirin's anti-inflammatory effects at higher doses.
    *   Inhibition of prostaglandin E (C) is a side effect of COX-1 inhibition (leading to reduced GI protection) but is not the mechanism for its antiplatelet effect.
    *   Aspirin does not inhibit thrombin (D); that is the mechanism of other anticoagulants.

### Question 6:
The main respiratory drive in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is:
A. Hypercapnic drive
**B. Hypoxic drive**
C. Baroreceptor stimulation
D. Respiratory alkalosis

**Explanation:**
*   In a healthy individual, the primary respiratory drive is the **hypercapnic drive**. Chemoreceptors in the brainstem are highly sensitive to levels of CO2 in the blood. When CO2 rises, breathing is stimulated.
*   In patients with severe COPD, they chronically retain high levels of CO2 (hypercapnia). Over time, the central chemoreceptors become desensitized to these high CO2 levels, and the hypercapnic drive becomes ineffective.
*   The body then switches to a backup system: the **hypoxic drive**. Peripheral chemoreceptors (in the carotid and aortic bodies) become the primary stimulus for breathing. These receptors are sensitive to low levels of oxygen (hypoxia).
*   Therefore, in a COPD patient, a drop in blood oxygen is what stimulates them to breathe. This is why administering high-flow oxygen can be dangerous, as it can eliminate their only drive to breathe.

### Question 7:
What sequence of steps is deemed the most suitable for the donning (putting on) of personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to patient treatment?
A. Gown, Mask, Goggles, Gloves, Hand Hygiene
B. Gloves, Gown, Mask, Goggles, Hand Hygiene
**C. Hand Hygiene, Gown, Mask, Goggles, Gloves**
D. Hand Hygiene, Gloves, Mask, Goggles, Gown

**Explanation:**
The correct sequence for donning PPE is designed to minimize contamination, moving from cleanest to dirtiest.

1.  **Hand Hygiene:** Start with clean hands to avoid contaminating the PPE you are about to put on.
2.  **Gown:** Put on the gown first.
3.  **Mask/Respirator:** Secure the mask over your nose and mouth.
4.  **Goggles/Face Shield:** Put on eye protection.
5.  **Gloves:** Put on gloves last. The gloves should go over the cuffs of the gown.

This sequence ensures that your hands are clean before touching your face (for the mask and goggles) and that the gloves are the last, most "contaminated" item to be put on before touching the patient.

### Question 8:
A 65-year-old diabetic patient is found to have an oroantral communication after an extraction, and a buccal advancement flap is necessary. Which of the following types of suture is the most appropriate for this procedure?
A. Silk
B. Plain catgut
C. Chromic catgut
**D. Vicryl (Polyglactin)**

**Explanation:**
The choice of suture depends on the patient's condition (diabetic, delayed healing) and the surgical site (major flap requiring stable, long-term closure).

*   **Patient Factors:** Diabetic patients experience delayed wound healing.
*   **Surgical Factors:** A buccal advancement flap is a major procedure that requires the sutures to maintain tension and hold the flap securely for an extended period (more than 1-2 weeks).
*   **Analysis of Options:**
    *   **Plain Catgut:** Resorbs in 3-5 days. Completely inappropriate as it will dissolve before any meaningful healing occurs.
    *   **Chromic Catgut:** Resorbs in 7-14 days. This is still too short for a diabetic patient's delayed healing. It is also a natural material that can induce a significant inflammatory tissue reaction.
    *   **Silk:** A non-resorbable suture. It is strong and maintains tension well, but has two major disadvantages: 1) It has a high "wicking effect," allowing bacteria to travel along the suture and potentially infect the site. 2) It requires a second appointment for removal, which can be traumatic and cause bleeding.
    *   **Vicryl (Polyglactin):** A synthetic, braided, resorbable suture. This is the best choice because:
        1.  **Longevity:** It retains significant tensile strength for 3-4 weeks and fully resorbs in 56-70 days, providing long-term support that is ideal for a diabetic patient's healing timeline.
        2.  **Biocompatibility:** As a synthetic material that resorbs via hydrolysis, it causes minimal tissue reaction compared to natural sutures like gut or silk.
        3.  **Resorbable:** It does not require a removal appointment.

### Question 9:
During a lateral mandibular movement, which of the following cusp inclines of the maxillary teeth are most likely to cause a non-working side interference?
A. Lingual inclines of the buccal cusps
**B. Buccal inclines of the palatal cusps**
C. Lingual inclines of the palatal cusps
D. Buccal inclines of the buccal cusps

**Explanation:**
This question tests knowledge of occlusal contacts during lateral excursions.

*   **Working Side:** The side the mandible moves *towards*.
*   **Non-Working Side (or Balancing Side):** The side the mandible moves *away from*.
*   **Non-Working Side Interference:** This is a contact between the maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth on the non-working side. It is considered the most destructive type of interference.
*   **The specific contact is:** The **inner inclines** of the **functional cusps**.
    *   In the maxilla, the functional cusps are the **palatal cusps**. Their inner aspect is the **buccal incline**.
    *   In the mandible, the functional cusps are the **buccal cusps**. Their inner aspect is the **lingual incline**.
*   Therefore, the non-working side interference on the maxilla occurs on the **buccal inclines of the palatal cusps**.

### Question 10:
Which of the following describes the effect of epinephrine on cardiac output and myocardial oxygen demand?
**A. Increases cardiac output and increases oxygen demand.**
B. Increases cardiac output without a change in oxygen demand.
C. Decreases cardiac output and increases oxygen demand.
D. Decreases cardiac output without a change in oxygen demand.

**Explanation:**
Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic drug that stimulates alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors.

*   **Effect on the Heart (Beta-1 stimulation):** Epinephrine directly stimulates Beta-1 receptors in the heart, leading to:
    *   **Increased Heart Rate** (Positive Chronotropy)
    *   **Increased Contractility** (Positive Inotropy - the force of contraction)
*   **Effect on Cardiac Output:** Cardiac Output = Heart Rate × Stroke Volume. Since epinephrine increases both heart rate and contractility (which increases stroke volume), the overall **cardiac output increases**.
*   **Effect on Oxygen Demand:** When the heart beats faster and more forcefully, it is performing more work. This increased workload requires more energy, and therefore **increases the heart's demand for oxygen**.
*   This is why epinephrine must be used with caution in patients with ischemic heart disease, as the increased oxygen demand may not be met by a compromised coronary circulation, potentially leading to angina or a myocardial infarction.

### Question 11:
Following the extraction of tooth #38, the site bleeds profusely. The dentist failed to obtain the patient's medical history, and it turns out the patient has hemophilia A. Which of the following ethical principles has been violated by the dentist?
A. Autonomy
B. Beneficence
**C. Nonmaleficence**
D. Justice

**Explanation:**
This scenario involves causing direct harm to a patient through negligence.

*   **Nonmaleficence:** This is the core principle of "do no harm." It obligates a healthcare provider to avoid causing unnecessary pain or suffering to a patient. By failing to take a medical history—a fundamental step in patient safety—the dentist performed a procedure that directly resulted in harm (profuse, uncontrolled bleeding). This is a clear violation of nonmaleficence.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Autonomy** refers to the patient's right to self-determination and informed consent. While related, the primary violation here is the physical harm caused, not the failure to respect the patient's decision-making.
    *   **Beneficence** is the duty to act in the best interest of the patient or to "do good." While failing to take a history is not "doing good," the more direct and severe violation is actively causing harm, which falls under nonmaleficence.
    *   **Justice** refers to fairness in treatment and allocation of resources. It is not relevant to this clinical error.

### Question 12:
A new intervention reduces the risk of peri-implantitis from 6% to 2%. What is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT)?
A. 10
B. 15
C. 20
**D. 25**

**Explanation:**
Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the average number of patients who need to receive a specific treatment to prevent one additional bad outcome. A lower NNT indicates a more effective treatment.

1.  **Calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):** This is the difference in risk between the control group and the treated group.
    *   Risk in control group (no intervention) = 6% or 0.06
    *   Risk in treated group (intervention) = 2% or 0.02
    *   ARR = Risk(control) - Risk(treated) = 6% - 2% = 4%
    *   ARR = 0.06 - 0.02 = 0.04

2.  **Calculate the NNT:** The NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR.
    *   NNT = 1 / ARR
    *   NNT = 1 / 0.04
    *   NNT = 25

This means you would need to treat 25 patients with the new intervention to prevent one case of peri-implantitis.

### Question 13:
A 5-year-old patient has an intruded primary tooth #51. Radiographic examination reveals foreshortening of the tooth. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?
**A. Periodic observation.**
B. Pulpectomy.
C. Pulpotomy.
D. Immediate extraction.

**Explanation:**
This question deals with the management of a traumatic intrusion injury to a primary tooth.

*   **Intruded Primary Tooth:** The standard of care for an intruded primary incisor, regardless of its position relative to the permanent tooth bud, is to **allow for spontaneous re-eruption**.
*   **Foreshortening:** A foreshortened radiographic image indicates that the apex of the intruded tooth has been displaced labially/buccally, away from the developing permanent tooth germ. This is a favorable sign, but it does not change the management. (An elongated image would suggest palatal/lingual displacement toward the germ).
*   **Management:** Active treatment like extraction or repositioning is generally avoided as it carries a high risk of damaging the underlying permanent tooth. The tooth should be monitored for re-eruption, which typically occurs within 6 months. Extraction is only indicated if the tooth becomes infected or fails to re-erupt.
*   Therefore, the correct management is **periodic observation**.

---

### Question 14:
A patient's radiographic evaluation reveals that all teeth have normal crown shapes but exhibit short roots and obliterated pulp chambers. Which of the following conditions is most likely associated with these findings?
**A. Dentin dysplasia type I**
B. Dentin dysplasia type II
C. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type II
D. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type III

**Explanation:**
The key features are **normal crowns** but abnormal roots and pulps.

*   **Dentin Dysplasia Type I (Radicular Type):** This is the classic presentation. The crowns are clinically and morphologically normal in shape and color. The defining features are radiographic: extremely short or "rootless" teeth, obliterated pulp chambers before eruption, and frequent periapical radiolucencies.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Dentin Dysplasia Type II (Coronal Type):** Primary teeth resemble dentinogenesis imperfecta (opalescent, bulbous). Permanent teeth have normal color but abnormal pulp morphology, specifically "thistle-tube" or flame-shaped pulp chambers, which are enlarged, not obliterated.
    *   **Dentinogenesis Imperfecta (Types II and III):** The most prominent feature is abnormal crowns. They are typically opalescent (blue-gray or yellow-brown), bulbous in shape, and show marked attrition. While pulps are obliterated and roots are short, the abnormal crown appearance rules it out. Type III (Brandywine type) is severe, with "shell teeth" and multiple pulp exposures.

### Question 15:
A 23-year-old female patient presents with bilateral dislocation of the mandibular condyles. Her symptoms have been recurring with frequent yawning. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?
A. Arthroscopy
B. Splint therapy
C. Arthrocentesis
**D. Eminectomy**

**Explanation:**
The patient is suffering from chronic recurrent dislocation, also known as subluxation. This is a mechanical problem where the condyle moves anterior to the articular eminence and gets locked.

*   **Conservative treatments** like splints might be tried, but for a recurring mechanical locking issue, a surgical solution is often necessary.
*   **Eminectomy:** This is a surgical procedure that involves recontouring or reducing the height of the articular eminence. By flattening the eminence, the path of the condyle is no longer obstructed, preventing it from getting stuck in an anteriorly dislocated position. This is a definitive treatment for chronic recurrent dislocation.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Arthrocentesis** (lavaging the joint space) and **Arthroscopy** (visualizing the joint) are primarily used for internal derangements involving disc displacement, inflammation, and adhesions (e.g., closed lock), not for a purely mechanical issue of the condyle passing over the eminence.

---

### Question 16:
Acantholysis is a histological feature seen in which of the following lesions?
A. Mucous membrane pemphigoid
**B. Pemphigus vulgaris**
C. Lichen planus
D. Erythema multiforme

**Explanation:**
*   **Acantholysis** is the loss of intercellular cohesion between keratinocytes (epithelial cells) due to the breakdown of desmosomes. This results in the formation of intraepithelial blisters and the presence of free-floating, rounded epithelial cells called **Tzanck cells**.
*   **Pemphigus Vulgaris:** This is the classic example of a disease caused by acantholysis. It is an autoimmune condition where autoantibodies target desmoglein proteins, which are components of desmosomes. This attack leads to the separation of epithelial cells from each other.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid:** The autoimmune attack is on the basement membrane components (hemidesmosomes), causing a clean separation of the entire epithelial layer from the underlying connective tissue. This is a **subepithelial split**, not acantholysis.
    *   **Lichen Planus** and **Erythema Multiforme** have different histopathologic mechanisms and do not exhibit acantholysis as their primary feature.

### Question 17:
A patient who consumed alcohol the previous night presents to your office for a tooth extraction. After the procedure, the patient is given acetaminophen to manage postoperative pain. Which of the following is the most likely outcome?
**A. Increased pain control due to microsomal enzyme inhibition.**
B. Increased pain control due to underlying liver disease.
C. Insufficient pain control due to microsomal enzyme induction.
D. No effect on pain control.

**Explanation:**
The effect of alcohol on liver metabolism depends on whether the consumption is acute or chronic.

*   **Acute Alcohol Consumption (e.g., "the previous night"):** Acute intake of alcohol **inhibits** the activity of the cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme system in the liver.
*   **Effect on Acetaminophen:** Acetaminophen is metabolized by these enzymes. When the enzymes are inhibited, the metabolism of acetaminophen is slowed down.
*   **Outcome:** Slower metabolism leads to higher and more prolonged plasma concentrations of the drug, resulting in a more pronounced or **increased effect** (in this case, increased analgesia).
*   **Chronic Alcoholism (Contrast):** Chronic alcohol consumption has the opposite effect; it *induces* (upregulates) the liver enzymes. In a chronic alcoholic, acetaminophen would be metabolized *faster*, leading to lower plasma levels and insufficient pain control (Option C).

---

### Question 18:
A researcher is evaluating two different periodontal treatments. Patients are assigned to treatment groups based on which clinic they visit (Clinic A vs. Clinic B), with one clinic offering only the basic treatment and the other providing an antibiotic adjunct. Which of the following biases does this study design risk introducing?
A. Recall bias
**B. Confounding**
C. Selection bias
D. Surveillance bias

**Explanation:**
This study design lacks randomization and groups patients by a pre-existing characteristic (which clinic they attend).

*   **Confounding:** A confounder is a third variable that is associated with both the exposure (the treatment) and the outcome (pocket depth reduction) and can distort the true relationship between them. In this case, the **clinic itself is a major confounding factor**.
    *   For example, patients who go to the more advanced Clinic B might have more severe disease to begin with. Or, Clinic B might have better clinicians or follow-up protocols. These factors, related to the clinic and not the antibiotic itself, could influence the outcome. The observed effect might be due to the "clinic effect" rather than the treatment effect.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Selection Bias** occurs when the method of choosing participants creates an unrepresentative sample. While related, confounding is the more precise term here because the bias comes from a third variable (the clinic) that is unevenly distributed between the treatment groups.
    *   **Recall Bias** relates to inaccuracies in participants' memory of past events; it's not relevant in this interventional study.
    *   **Surveillance Bias** occurs when one group is monitored more closely than another, leading to more frequent detection of outcomes. This is not the primary flaw described.

### Question 19:
Chlorothiazide is a weakly acidic drug with a pKa of 6.5. If administered orally, at which of the following sites of absorption will the drug be most readily able to pass through the membrane?
A. Mouth (pH 7.1)
**B. Stomach (pH 2.5)**
C. Duodenum (pH 7.2)
D. Ileum (pH 8.0)

**Explanation:**
The principle of drug absorption across lipid membranes is that drugs pass most easily in their **non-ionized, lipid-soluble** form. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation governs this relationship.

*   **The Rule:**
    *   An **acidic drug** will be mostly non-ionized in an **acidic environment**.
    *   A **basic drug** will be mostly non-ionized in a **basic (alkaline) environment**.
*   **Application:** Chlorothiazide is a weakly acidic drug. To be in its non-ionized form for easy absorption, it needs to be in an acidic environment.
*   **Conclusion:** Of the options provided, the **stomach (pH ~2.5)** is the most acidic environment. Therefore, the acidic drug will be most readily absorbed there. In the more alkaline environments of the mouth and intestines, it would be mostly in its ionized form, which is not easily absorbed.

### Question 20:
Which of the following statements best explains why cranial vault bones exhibit appositional growth rather than interstitial growth?
A. The presence of synchondroses.
**B. The lack of a cartilage precursor.**
C. The influence of lymphoid tissue proliferation.
D. They are derived from ectoderm.

**Explanation:**
There are two main types of bone growth:

1.  **Interstitial Growth:** Growth from within. This is only possible in cartilage, where chondrocytes can divide and secrete new matrix, expanding the tissue from the inside. This is how long bones grow in length at the epiphyseal plates (a process of endochondral ossification).
2.  **Appositional Growth:** Growth by adding new layers to the outer surface. Osteoblasts on the surface of the bone deposit new bone matrix. All bones can grow in width this way.

*   **Cranial Vault Bones:** These bones (e.g., frontal, parietal) are formed by **intramembranous ossification**. This process does not involve a cartilage model. Bone forms directly within a membrane of mesenchymal tissue.
*   **Conclusion:** Because the cranial vault bones **lack a cartilage precursor**, they are incapable of interstitial growth. Their growth occurs solely by appositional growth at their surfaces and sutures.
*   **Incorrect Option A:** Synchondroses (cartilaginous joints) are characteristic of the cranial *base*, which undergoes endochondral ossification and does exhibit interstitial growth.

### Question 21:
In a patient with a complete cleft lip and palate, when is the optimal time to perform an alveolar bone graft?
A. After the permanent canine on the cleft side has fully erupted.
**B. Just before the permanent canine on the cleft side begins erupting.**
C. During the initial lip repair surgery.
D. At any time based on the patient's convenience.

**Explanation:**
The timing of surgeries for cleft lip and palate is critical and follows a specific sequence to optimize growth and function.

*   **Alveolar Bone Graft Purpose:** The goal is to create a bony bridge across the alveolar cleft to:
    1.  Unite the maxillary segments and stabilize the arch.
    2.  Provide bone for the permanent canine to erupt into.
    3.  Provide periodontal support for the teeth adjacent to the cleft.
    4.  Close the oro-nasal fistula.
*   **Optimal Timing:** The procedure is timed to coincide with the eruption of the permanent canine. It is performed during the mixed dentition stage (**ages 6-10 years**), specifically **just before the canine erupts**, when the canine root is approximately 1/2 to 2/3 formed.
*   **Rationale:** Placing the graft before eruption allows the canine to erupt through the newly grafted bone, which stimulates the bone, helps develop a normal periodontal ligament, and brings its own alveolar bone housing with it, leading to a much more stable and physiologic result. Performing it after eruption (A) would be much less effective. Performing it during initial lip repair (C) would restrict maxillary growth.

### Question 22:
Which of the following medications increases a patient's risk of intraoral candidiasis?
A. Warfarin
**B. Cyclosporine**
C. Omeprazole
D. Metformin

**Explanation:**
Intraoral candidiasis is an opportunistic infection caused by the fungus *Candida albicans*. It flourishes when the host's immune system is compromised.

*   **Cyclosporine:** This is a potent **immunosuppressant** drug. It is commonly prescribed to prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat various autoimmune diseases. By suppressing the immune system, cyclosporine significantly increases the risk of opportunistic infections, including oral candidiasis.
*   **Other Options:**
    *   **Warfarin** is an anticoagulant.
    *   **Omeprazole** is a proton pump inhibitor used for acid reflux.
    *   **Metformin** is an antidiabetic medication.
    *   While poorly controlled diabetes can be a risk factor for candidiasis, cyclosporine directly causes immunosuppression, making it the most direct and potent risk factor among the choices.

### Question 23:
A 55-year-old patient is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma. During dental examination, a bony impacted and healthy tooth #37 was discovered. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?
A. Extract the tooth and start chemotherapy after 3 weeks of healing.
B. Extract the tooth and start chemotherapy immediately.
**C. Start chemotherapy without the extraction of tooth #37.**
D. Defer chemotherapy and monitor the tooth for 6 months.

**Explanation:**
The decision involves weighing the risk of delaying cancer treatment against the risk of the tooth causing a complication during chemotherapy.

*   **Risk of Extraction:** Extracting the tooth would require delaying life-saving chemotherapy for several weeks to allow for initial healing. For an aggressive cancer like SCC, any delay can negatively impact the patient's prognosis.
*   **Risk of Retention:** The risk is that the tooth could become infected during or after chemotherapy when the patient is severely immunocompromised. An infection at that stage would be a serious complication.
*   **The Key Information:** The tooth is described as **"bony impacted"** and **"healthy."**
*   **Clinical Guideline:** A tooth that is fully impacted in bone with no associated pathology (no cysts, no communication with the oral cavity) has a very low risk of causing problems. The risk of delaying cancer treatment is far greater than the low risk posed by retaining the asymptomatic, fully impacted tooth.
*   **Conclusion:** The most appropriate management is to **proceed with chemotherapy without delay** and leave the tooth in place. Extracting the tooth is not indicated and would cause unacceptable harm by delaying cancer care.

### Question 24:
Which of the following is true with regards to Lesion Sterilization and Tissue Repair (LSTR)?
A. It involves the instrumentation of the root canal of primary teeth.
**B. It is indicated for primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis or necrosis.**
C. It is always preferred over pulpectomy.
D. The recommended antibiotic mixture contains minocycline.

**Explanation:**
LSTR is a biological approach to treating infected primary teeth.

*   **Correct Statement (B):** LSTR is a treatment option for non-vital primary teeth, meaning those with **irreversible pulpitis or necrosis**. Its goal is to disinfect the canal system to allow for healing and preserve the tooth until normal exfoliation.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **(A) No Instrumentation:** LSTR is fundamentally a **non-instrumentation** technique. The pulp chamber is opened and irrigated, but files are not used within the canals.
    *   **(C) Not Always Preferred:** Pulpectomy is the traditional treatment of choice. LSTR is typically considered when a pulpectomy is not feasible, such as in teeth with significant root resorption where instrumentation would be difficult or impossible.
    *   **(D) No Minocycline:** The classic LSTR antibiotic paste is a "triple-mix" of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and clindamycin. **Minocycline** (a tetracycline) was part of an earlier formulation but is now avoided because it causes significant tooth discoloration.

### Question 25:
A 28-year-old patient presents with gingivitis. Clinical examination reveals gingival erythema and bleeding on probing, without clinical attachment loss. Histologically, which type of cells would most likely predominate the affected gingival tissue?
A. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and macrophages
B. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and T-lymphocytes
**C. T-lymphocytes and plasma cells**
D. B-lymphocytes and mast cells

**Explanation:**
The clinical signs (erythema, bleeding, no attachment loss) are characteristic of **established gingivitis**. Gingivitis progresses through distinct histological stages with different predominant cell types.

*   **Initial Lesion (2-4 days):** Primarily **PMNs (neutrophils)** and some macrophages. Clinically, it is not very apparent.
*   **Early Lesion (4-7 days):** PMNs are still present, but **T-lymphocytes** begin to dominate the infiltrate. Clinical signs like erythema begin to appear.
*   **Established Lesion (2-3 weeks and beyond):** This is chronic gingivitis. The lesion is now dominated by **plasma cells** and **T-lymphocytes**. Plasma cells are activated B-cells that produce antibodies. This stage corresponds to the classic clinical signs of gingivitis.
*   **Advanced Lesion (Periodontitis):** The infiltrate is similar to the established lesion, but now there is bone loss and attachment loss.

Since the patient has clear clinical signs of chronic gingivitis, the histology will reflect the established lesion, which is predominated by T-lymphocytes and plasma cells.

### Question 26:
A 58-year-old male presents with recurrent swelling in the lower right posterior region. Clinical examination reveals a periodontal pocket associated with tooth #46 with purulent exudate upon probing. A fistula is observed on the buccal gingiva. Tooth #46 produces a positive response to vitality testing. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Chronic apical abscess
B. Acute apical abscess
C. Endo-perio lesion
**D. Periodontal abscess**

**Explanation:**
The key to this diagnosis is integrating the clinical signs with the pulp vitality test result.

*   **Clinical Signs:** The signs—a deep periodontal pocket, purulent (pus) exudate, swelling, and a fistula—all point towards an abscess.
*   **Pulp Vitality:** The tooth gives a **positive response to vitality testing**. This is the crucial piece of information. A positive response means the pulp is vital (alive).
*   **Differential Diagnosis:**
    *   **Apical Abscess (A, B):** An apical abscess is of endodontic origin, meaning the pulp is necrotic (dead). The tooth would therefore be non-vital and would not respond to vitality testing.
    *   **Endo-Perio Lesion (C):** A primary endodontic lesion (with or without secondary perio involvement) would also originate from a necrotic pulp, so the tooth would be non-vital.
    *   **Periodontal Abscess (D):** This is an abscess that originates from the periodontal tissues (the gingiva and periodontal ligament), typically from a pre-existing deep periodontal pocket. The pulp of the tooth is not involved and remains vital.
*   **Conclusion:** Since the tooth is vital, the infection must be purely periodontal in origin. This is a classic presentation of a periodontal abscess.

### Question 27:
Which of the following features is most commonly associated with a higher than average mandibular plane angle on a cephalometric analysis?
**A. Increased lower anterior facial height**
B. Decreased lower anterior facial height
C. Deep bite
D. Horizontal growth pattern

**Explanation:**
The mandibular plane angle is a key indicator of a patient's vertical facial dimension and growth pattern.

*   **High Mandibular Plane Angle (Steep Mandible):** This indicates a **vertical growth pattern**. The mandible has grown more downward and backward than forward. This pattern is associated with:
    *   **Increased lower anterior facial height (LAFH)**.
    *   A long, narrow face.
    *   A tendency towards an anterior open bite.
*   **Low Mandibular Plane Angle (Flat Mandible):** This indicates a **horizontal growth pattern**. The mandible has grown more forward than downward. This pattern is associated with:
    *   **Decreased (short) lower anterior facial height (LAFH)**.
    *   A short, square face.
    *   A tendency towards a deep bite.

Therefore, a high mandibular plane angle is most commonly associated with an increased lower anterior facial height.

### Question 28:
Under which of the following conditions is a lingual plate major connector indicated instead of a lingual bar?
A. When more rigidity is required.
B. When the remaining teeth are widely spaced.
**C. When the remaining anterior teeth have lost periodontal support.**
D. When there is sufficient space in the floor of the mouth.

**Explanation:**
A lingual bar is generally the major connector of choice for a mandibular RPD due to its hygienic design. A lingual plate is chosen only when specific indications are met.

*   **Primary Indication for Lingual Plate:** The most important indication is when the remaining anterior teeth are **periodontally compromised** and have lost bone support.
    *   The lingual plate covers the cingula of the anterior teeth and acts as a **splint**, providing support, distributing occlusal forces, and stabilizing the weakened teeth.
*   **Another Key Indication:** When there is **insufficient floor of mouth depth** (less than 7-8mm from the gingival margin to the floor of the mouth) to accommodate the height of a lingual bar without impinging on the tissues.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   (A) A properly designed lingual bar is sufficiently rigid for almost all cases. Rigidity is not the primary reason to choose a plate.
    *   (B) Widely spaced teeth are a contraindication for a plate unless a "step-back" design is used, but a bar is preferred to avoid unsightly metal display.
    *   (D) Sufficient space is the primary requirement for a **lingual bar**, not a plate.

### Question 29:
Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of estrogen on bone?
A. Increased osteoclast proliferation.
B. Increased induction of osteoclasts through cytokines.
**C. Increased osteoclast apoptosis.**
D. Decreasing osteoclast apoptosis.

**Explanation:**
Estrogen plays a crucial anti-resorptive role in maintaining bone density. It works primarily by regulating the activity and lifespan of osteoclasts.

*   **Primary Mechanism:** Estrogen's main effect is to **increase osteoclast apoptosis** (programmed cell death). By promoting the death of osteoclasts, it reduces the total number of active bone-resorbing cells, which shifts the balance of bone remodeling towards formation and away from resorption.
*   **Secondary Mechanism:** Estrogen also suppresses the production of pro-resorptive cytokines (like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and inhibits the RANKL/RANK signaling pathway, which is essential for osteoclast differentiation and activation.
*   **Incorrect Options:** Options A, B, and D all describe effects that would lead to *increased* bone resorption, which is the opposite of estrogen's function. The bone loss seen in postmenopausal women is a direct result of the loss of these protective estrogen effects.

### Question 30:
Mild unilateral maxillary constriction will most likely result in:
A. Unilateral posterior crossbite without a functional shift.
**B. Unilateral posterior crossbite with a functional shift.**
C. Bilateral posterior crossbite.
D. Edge-to-edge occlusion with no crossbite.

**Explanation:**
The key to this question is the word **"mild."**

*   **Mild Constriction:** When the maxillary arch is only mildly constricted, the posterior teeth on that side will occlude in a **cusp-to-cusp** or **edge-to-edge** relationship in centric relation.
*   **Functional Shift:** This cusp-to-cusp position is unstable and inefficient for chewing. To achieve a more stable occlusion with better intercuspation, the patient will subconsciously **shift their mandible** to the side of the constriction.
*   **Resulting Occlusion:** This shift moves the mandibular teeth further buccally on the constricted side, creating a **unilateral posterior crossbite**. Because the crossbite is only present *after* the mandible has shifted from its centric position, it is defined as a unilateral posterior crossbite **with a functional shift**.
*   **Contrast with Severe Constriction:** If the constriction were severe, the maxillary teeth would already be fully palatal to the mandibular teeth in centric relation. There would be no initial cusp-to-cusp interference and therefore no need for the mandible to shift. This would result in a "true" bilateral or unilateral crossbite *without* a functional shift.

Here is the study guide derived from the second lecture transcript.

### Question 31:
In constructing a mandibular complete denture for a patient with a resorbed ridge, the artificial teeth in the molar region should be placed where?
A. Labial to the residual ridge
B. Over the residual ridge
**C. Lingual to the residual ridge**
D. Any of the above

**Explanation:**
The placement of denture teeth should be in the "neutral zone" to ensure stability. This zone is determined by the balance of forces from the tongue and the cheeks. The pattern of bone resorption dictates where this neutral zone is relative to the current ridge crest.

*   **Mandibular Resorption Pattern:** In the posterior region, the mandible resorbs primarily from the occlusal and lingual aspects, causing the crest of the residual ridge to become positioned more buccally than the original position of the teeth.
*   **Neutral Zone:** To place the teeth back in their original, stable position, they must be set **lingual** to the new, buccally-positioned ridge crest.
*   **Other Areas:**
    *   **Anterior Region:** The ridge resorbs more from the labial, so teeth are set slightly labial to the ridge.
    *   **Premolar Region:** Resorption is more even, so teeth are set directly over the ridge.
Placing teeth over the ridge in the molar area of a resorbed mandible would position them too far buccally, leading to instability.

### Question 32:
Which of the following types of surgeries is the most appropriate for the management of a 5-millimeter mid-buccal recession affecting teeth #11, #12, and #13?
**A. Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG)**
B. Free gingival graft (FGG)
C. Laterally positioned flap
D. Coronally positioned flap

**Explanation:**
The choice of procedure depends on the recession depth, location (aesthetic zone), and the amount of remaining keratinized tissue.

*   **Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft (SCTG):** This is the gold standard for root coverage, especially for deep recessions in the aesthetic zone. It has a dual blood supply, results in excellent color match, and is highly predictable.
*   **Why others are incorrect:**
    *   **Coronally Positioned Flap (CPF):** This procedure requires an adequate band (at least 3mm) of keratinized tissue apical to the recession to be advanced coronally. A 5mm recession is very deep, and it is highly unlikely that sufficient keratinized tissue remains, making this procedure contraindicated.
    *   **Free Gingival Graft (FGG):** While it creates keratinized tissue, it results in poor aesthetics (a "patchy" look) and is not the primary choice for root coverage in the maxillary anterior.
    *   **Laterally Positioned Flap:** This is only indicated for single, narrow recession defects where there is adequate donor tissue on an adjacent tooth. It is not suitable for multiple adjacent teeth.

### Question 33:
Which of the following plain local anesthetics can be administered for a patient with an unknown allergy to metabisulfite?
A. Mepivacaine 2%
B. Articaine 4%
C. Lidocaine 2%
**D. Prilocaine 4%**

**Explanation:**
The key to this question is knowing which local anesthetic formulations are available *without* a vasoconstrictor. Sodium metabisulfite is a preservative added only to anesthetic cartridges that contain a vasoconstrictor (like epinephrine or levonordefrin). A "plain" anesthetic does not contain metabisulfite.

*   **Mepivacaine:** The 2% solution contains levonordefrin. The **3% solution** is plain.
*   **Articaine:** The 4% solution always contains epinephrine. There is no plain formulation.
*   **Lidocaine:** The 2% solution always contains epinephrine.
*   **Prilocaine:** The **4% solution** is available in two forms: one with epinephrine and one that is **plain**.

Therefore, of the options provided, only Prilocaine 4% is available as a plain solution and would be safe for a patient with a metabisulfite allergy.

### Question 34:
A vital mandibular molar was recently restored with a full-coverage crown. The patient returned a few days later with complaints of severe, spontaneous pain that interferes with sleep. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A. Adjust occlusion and reassess.
B. Remove the crown, place a temporary, and reassess.
**C. Initiate endodontic therapy through the crown.**
D. Remove the crown, complete endodontic therapy, and then fabricate a new crown.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The symptoms (severe, spontaneous pain, waking the patient from sleep) are pathognomonic for **irreversible pulpitis**.
*   **Treatment:** The definitive treatment for irreversible pulpitis is root canal therapy.
*   **Management Strategy:** The principle of "repair is better than replacement" applies. It is standard and conservative practice to perform the root canal by creating an access opening **through the existing crown**. Removing a newly cemented, well-fitting crown is unnecessary, destructive to the underlying tooth structure, and more costly for the patient. After the root canal is complete, the access opening in the crown is restored with a permanent filling material like composite.

---

### Question 35:
Which of the following statements regarding implant-supported crowns is true?
A. Temporary cement should never be used to lute implant crowns.
B. Resin cements are the preferred luting agent for implant-supported crowns.
**C. Screw-retained crowns are preferred when the abutment height is limited.**
D. Custom abutments are contraindicated when restoring a single implant.

**Explanation:**
*   **Correct Statement (C):** A cement-retained crown relies on the height and taper of the abutment for mechanical retention. If the interocclusal space is limited, the abutment will be short, providing poor retention. In such cases, a **screw-retained crown** is preferred because its retention is mechanical (via the screw) and independent of abutment height.
*   **Why others are false:**
    *   **(A)** **Temporary cements are the preferred choice** for implant crowns. They allow for retrievability if the screw loosens or the crown needs to be removed for any reason. They also make cleanup of excess cement easier, reducing the risk of peri-implantitis.
    *   **(B)** **Resin cements are generally contraindicated.** They create a very strong bond, making retrieval nearly impossible, and are extremely difficult to clean from the subgingival sulcus, making them a high risk for causing cement-induced peri-implantitis.
    *   **(D)** Custom abutments are very commonly and effectively used for single implants to create an ideal emergence profile and optimal margin placement.

### Question 36:
A 55-year-old female patient presents with a diagnosis of a vertical root fracture in tooth #17. Her medical history reveals that she has been taking oral bisphosphonates for the past two years for the management of osteoporosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate management approach?
**A. Extract after consultation with a medical physician.**
B. Ask the medical physician to stop the bisphosphonate for two months, then extract.
C. Ask the medical physician to reduce the dose of bisphosphonate for two months, then extract.
D. Refer for apicoectomy and retrofill.

**Explanation:**
*   **Dental Diagnosis:** A vertical root fracture has a hopeless prognosis. The tooth must be extracted. Endodontic surgery is not a treatment for a VRF.
*   **Medical Consideration:** The patient is taking a **low-dose oral bisphosphonate**.
*   **Guidelines for Management:**
    1.  For patients on low-dose oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis (less than 4 years, no other risk factors), there are **no required alterations to the treatment plan**. The risk of developing Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ) is very low.
    2.  A "drug holiday" (stopping the medication) is **not effective or recommended**. Bisphosphonates accumulate in bone and have an extremely long half-life, so stopping the drug for a few months does not significantly alter the risk.
    3.  The tooth must be extracted. Consulting with the physician is a prudent step to confirm the patient's overall medical status but will not change the need for the extraction.

### Question 37:
After a dental healthcare worker received a 3-dose series of the hepatitis B vaccine, testing two months later indicated a lack of immunity. What is the appropriate course of action?
A. Administer a single booster dose.
**B. Repeat the three-dose series of the vaccine.**
C. Test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
D. Consider the worker immune and take no further action.

**Explanation:**
The CDC and public health guidelines have a clear protocol for vaccine non-responders.
1.  **Initial Non-response:** If a person fails to develop adequate antibodies after the first complete 3-dose series, the next step is to **repeat the entire 3-dose series**.
2.  **Second Non-response:** After the second full series, the person is re-tested. If they *still* lack immunity, they are then tested for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to determine if they are a chronic carrier of the virus.
3.  **Final Status:** If the HBsAg test is negative, the person is considered a true "non-responder" and must be counseled on extra precautions, as they are not protected.

### Question 38:
A patient presents with pain. Tooth #35 has a deep MOD composite restoration and does not respond to a cold test. A pocket of 14mm is evident on the buccal surface of the tooth. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management?
A. Extraction of the tooth.
**B. Root canal treatment.**
C. Crown lengthening and a new crown.
D. Guided tissue regeneration.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The combination of a non-vital tooth (no response to cold test) and a deep, isolated pocket points to a **primary endodontic lesion**. The infection from the necrotic pulp has drained out through the periodontal ligament space, creating a sinus tract that mimics a deep periodontal pocket.
*   **Treatment Priority:** The source of the infection is the necrotic pulp inside the tooth. Therefore, the primary and essential first step is to treat the source with **root canal therapy**.
*   **Prognosis:** In many cases, once the endodontic infection is eliminated, the deep "pocket" (which is actually a fistula) will heal on its own. Periodontal therapy is only considered after re-evaluating the site several months after the root canal treatment is completed.

### Question 39:
What effect does increasing the milliamperage (mA) have on an X-ray image?
A. Decreased film density
**B. Increased film density**
C. Increased image contrast
D. Decreased image contrast

**Explanation:**
*   **Milliamperage (mA):** This setting controls the quantity of electrons flowing in the x-ray tube, which in turn controls the **quantity of x-ray photons** produced per unit of time.
*   **Effect on Image:** An increase in mA produces more photons. More photons striking the sensor or film will result in a **darker** image. The overall degree of blackening on a radiograph is called **density**.
*   **Contrast:** Image contrast (the difference between light and dark areas) is primarily controlled by the **kilovoltage peak (kVp)**, which determines the energy or penetrating power of the photons.

### Question 40:
A 17-year-old patient presents with petechiae on the palate, difficulty swallowing, and enlargement of the lingual tonsils. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Acute myeloid leukemia
B. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
**C. Infectious mononucleosis**
D. Aplastic anemia

**Explanation:**
This is a classic clinical presentation, especially in this age group.
*   **Infectious Mononucleosis (Mono):** Caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), it commonly presents with a triad of fever, pharyngitis (sore throat/difficulty swallowing due to enlarged tonsils), and lymphadenopathy. A key diagnostic sign frequently seen is **palatal petechiae** (small, pinpoint red spots on the soft palate).
*   **Other Options:** While conditions like leukemia or aplastic anemia can cause petechiae due to low platelet counts, they are not typically associated with the severe exudative pharyngitis and tonsillar enlargement seen in mono. HHT causes distinct, blanching telangiectasias, not petechiae.

### Question 41:
During root canal treatment, an instrument separated. The fragment was successfully bypassed, and the canal was fully obturated. A follow-up a few months later revealed a new periapical radiolucency. The patient is asymptomatic. What is the most appropriate management?
A. Monitor in 6 months.
B. Conventional endodontic retreatment.
**C. Carry out an apicoectomy and retrofill of the affected root.**
D. Extraction of the tooth.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The development of a *new* radiolucency after treatment is a sign of **post-treatment disease**, or a failed root canal.
*   **Treatment Options:**
    *   **Monitoring (A):** This is incorrect. A new, developing lesion is a sign of active infection and must be treated.
    *   **Retreatment (B):** Conventional retreatment is the first choice *if* the original treatment is deficient (e.g., short fill, missed canals) and the canals are accessible. However, in this case, there is a separated instrument at the apex. Attempting to remove it via a coronal approach is highly risky and often unsuccessful. Since the file was already bypassed and the canal obturated, retreatment offers little benefit.
    *   **Apicoectomy (C):** This is the most appropriate management. Surgical endodontics (apicoectomy with retrofill) allows the clinician to access the apex directly, remove the apical tip of the root along with the separated instrument fragment, and seal the canal system from the apex (retrograde). This addresses the source of the failure without disturbing the existing crown and post/core.
    *   **Extraction (D):** This is too aggressive. The tooth is restorable and can be saved with surgical intervention.

---

### Question 42:
Tooth #26 of a 9-year-old patient has pronounced, deep, stained occlusal fissures. A bitewing radiograph shows a normal dentinoenamel junction (DEJ). What is the most appropriate management?
A. Preventive resin restoration (PRR)
**B. Application of fissure sealants.**
C. Topical fluoride application every 3 months.
D. No treatment is necessary.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The key findings are "deep stained fissures" and a "normal DEJ" on the radiograph. This means there is no radiographic evidence of caries penetrating into the dentin. The staining is in the fissure, but there is no cavitation or demineralization into dentin.
*   **Treatment:** This is the classic indication for a **fissure sealant**. Sealants are a preventive measure used to seal deep, non-carious pits and fissures that are at high risk for developing decay.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **PRR (A):** This is a restorative procedure indicated when there is a small, cavitated carious lesion confined to the enamel or just into the dentin. Since there is no caries into dentin here, a PRR is too invasive.
    *   **Fluoride (C):** While helpful, it doesn't physically block the deep fissures from plaque accumulation like a sealant does.
    *   **No treatment (D):** This is inappropriate given the "pronounced deep" fissures, which represent a high-risk morphology.

### Question 43:
A 12-year-old asthmatic patient is having a restoration done. Following local anesthesia, the patient begins wheezing and complains of difficulty breathing. What is the most appropriate immediate management?
A. Terminate the procedure and administer epinephrine.
B. Terminate the procedure and encourage the patient to breathe into a paper bag.
**C. Terminate the procedure and administer a beta-2 agonist inhaler (e.g., Salbutamol).**
D. Terminate the procedure and immediately activate 911.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The patient is having an **acute asthma attack**.
*   **Immediate Management:** The first-line treatment for an acute asthma attack is the administration of a rapid-acting **bronchodilator**. This is typically a **beta-2 agonist inhaler** (e.g., Salbutamol/Albuterol/Ventolin), which the patient should have with them. This medication relaxes the smooth muscles of the airways, relieving the bronchospasm.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Epinephrine (A):** This is a second-line treatment, used only if the patient does not respond to the inhaler or if the attack is life-threatening.
    *   **Paper Bag (B):** This is the treatment for hyperventilation, not asthma. It would worsen the hypoxia in an asthma attack.
    *   **Activate 911 (D):** This should be done, but only *after* administering the first-line treatment. The most appropriate *immediate* step is to provide the bronchodilator.

---

### Question 44:
In the management of metabolic acidosis due to aspirin overdose, urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate is employed primarily for which of the following reasons?
**A. To reduce the renal tubular reabsorption of aspirin.**
B. To increase the renal tubular reabsorption of aspirin.
C. To decrease the ionization of aspirin in the renal tubules.
D. To correct the systemic metabolic acidosis directly.

**Explanation:**
This is another application of the principle of drug ionization and excretion.
*   **Aspirin:** Is a weak acid (acetylsalicylic acid).
*   **Renal Excretion:** To be excreted in the urine, a drug must remain in its **ionized** form, as this form is water-soluble and cannot easily be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the lipid membranes of the renal tubules.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  By administering sodium bicarbonate, the urine is made more **alkaline**.
    2.  In an alkaline environment, the weak acid (aspirin) will be predominantly in its **ionized** form.
    3.  This "traps" the aspirin in the renal tubules, preventing it from being reabsorbed back into the body.
    4.  The result is a significant **increase in the excretion** of aspirin from the body.
*   Therefore, the primary reason for alkalinizing the urine is to reduce renal tubular reabsorption by increasing ionization.

### Question 45:
Which surgical technique is most suitable to treat a high frenal attachment with a wide base for a patient wanting to get dentures soon?
A. Simple excision
B. Z-plasty
**C. Localized vestibuloplasty with secondary epithelialization.**
D. Labial notch in the denture base.

**Explanation:**
The choice of frenectomy technique depends on the morphology of the frenum.
*   **Narrow-based frenum:** A simple excision or a Z-plasty is effective. A Z-plasty is superior as it lengthens the tissue and reduces scar contracture.
*   **Wide-based frenum:** When the frenum has a wide, fan-shaped base inserting into the vestibule, simply excising it is not enough. A **localized vestibuloplasty with secondary epithelialization** is the indicated procedure. This technique involves dissecting away the muscle fibers over a broad area and suturing the mucosal edge higher up in the vestibule, effectively deepening the vestibule and eliminating the broad pull of the frenum. The exposed periosteum then heals by secondary intention.
*   A labial notch in the denture is a way to *accommodate* a frenum, not treat it.

---

### Question 46:
A patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with obstruction of the submandibular duct. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial imaging technique?
A. Cone-beam CT (CBCT)
B. Panoramic radiograph
**C. Mandibular standard occlusal radiograph**
D. Sialography

**Explanation:**
*   **Condition:** The likely cause of obstruction is a sialolith (salivary stone).
*   **Location:** The submandibular duct (Wharton's duct) runs along the floor of the mouth.
*   **Imaging:** The best and simplest initial radiograph to visualize the floor of the mouth and the path of Wharton's duct is a **mandibular standard occlusal radiograph**. It provides a clear view without superimposition and can readily show radiopaque sialoliths.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **CBCT** would work but is too much radiation and cost for an initial investigation.
    *   **Panoramic** radiographs are poor for visualizing the floor of the mouth due to superimposition of the mandible. They are useful for stones in the parotid gland.
    *   **Sialography** is an invasive technique involving injecting contrast dye and is used for investigating ductal pathology, but not as the first-line imaging for a suspected stone.

### Question 47:
Which of the following best explains why artificial teeth should not be placed over the ascending portion of the mandibular ramus in complete denture fabrication?
A. The denture base terminates before the ascending ramus.
B. The teeth would interfere with the retromolar pad.
C. The teeth would encroach on the tongue space.
**D. Occlusal forces on the inclined ramus would dislodge the mandibular denture.**

**Explanation:**
The placement of denture teeth must follow biomechanical principles to ensure stability.
*   **The Problem:** The ascending ramus is an inclined plane.
*   **The Force:** Occlusal forces are directed primarily vertically.
*   **The Result:** If a denture tooth is placed on this incline, any vertical occlusal force will be resolved into components: one vertical and one **anteriorly-directed horizontal force**. This horizontal force will act to push the entire mandibular denture forward and dislodge it. To maintain stability, denture teeth must be placed on the horizontal portion of the residual ridge only.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   (A) The denture base *should* extend onto the retromolar pad, which is at the base of the ascending ramus, for support.
    *   (B) The teeth are placed *anterior* to the ascending ramus; they don't interfere with the retromolar pad itself.
    *   (C) The ascending ramus is too far posterior to interfere with the main body of the tongue space.

### Question 48:
You have designed a mandibular Kennedy Class I RPD with rests on #34 and #44. What change creates a destructive first-class lever system?
A. Adding indirect retainers on #33 and #43.
B. Using mesial rests with I-bar clasps.
**C. Placing a distal occlusal rest and a circumferential clasp on the abutment.**
D. Using a wrought-wire clasp.

**Explanation:**
In a distal extension RPD (Class I), the goal is to *avoid* a Class I lever, which is destructive to the abutment tooth.
*   **Lever System Components:**
    *   **Fulcrum (F):** The most posterior rest on the abutment tooth.
    *   **Resistance (R):** The retentive clasp tip resisting dislodgement.
    *   **Effort (E):** The force applied on the denture base during function.
*   **Class I Lever:** The fulcrum is between the effort and the resistance (E-F-R). This magnifies the force applied to the retentive clasp, torquing the abutment tooth.
*   **How to Create a Class I Lever (C):** Placing a **distal rest (F)** and a **buccal circumferential clasp (R)** on the same tooth creates this destructive lever. When the denture base is pushed down (E), the framework pivots on the distal rest (F), causing the rigid clasp tip (R) to be torqued upwards and distally against the tooth.
*   **How to Avoid a Class I Lever (B):** Using a **mesial rest** changes the configuration to a Class II lever (F-R-E), which is non-destructive. The RPI system (Rest on mesial, Plate on lingual, I-bar on buccal) is designed specifically to achieve this.

### Question 49:
Premature exfoliation of the primary mandibular canines is most commonly associated with which of the following conditions?
A. Early childhood caries
B. Trauma
C. Serial extraction therapy
**D. Arch length deficiency**

**Explanation:**
This is a classic sign of developing crowding.
*   **Mechanism:** When the permanent mandibular incisors erupt, they are significantly larger than the primary incisors they replace. If there is insufficient space in the arch (**arch length deficiency**), the erupting permanent lateral incisors will have their roots positioned against the roots of the adjacent primary canines.
*   **Result:** The pressure from the erupting laterals causes resorption of the primary canine roots, leading to their **premature exfoliation**.
*   This is an important diagnostic sign that signals significant crowding is present and that the permanent canines will likely be blocked out of the arch.
*   **Incorrect Option C:** Serial extraction is a *treatment* for arch length deficiency; it is not the *cause* of the premature exfoliation. The deficiency itself is the root cause.

### Question 50:
A case-control study shows that smoking is associated with a relative risk of 2.5 for oral leukoplakia. The study includes only hospitalized patients. What is the primary concern with this study?
A. Recall bias
**B. Selection bias**
C. Confounding bias
D. Surveillance bias

**Explanation:**
*   **The Flaw:** The study population is restricted to **hospitalized patients**.
*   **Selection Bias:** This is the primary concern. Hospitalized patients are not representative of the general population. They are sicker and may have different smoking habits, comorbidities, or other characteristics compared to non-hospitalized individuals. Using this group to draw conclusions about the general population introduces selection bias, which threatens the **external validity** (generalizability) of the study's findings.
*   **Other Biases:**
    *   Confounding is possible (e.g., hospitalized patients may also drink more alcohol), but the most fundamental flaw in the study design itself is the non-representative selection of the sample.
    *   Recall and surveillance biases are not the main issues described.

### Question 51:
A simple hinge articulator can be used to detect which of the following interferences?
A. Working side interferences
B. Non-working side interferences
**C. Incisor interferences (in centric)**
D. None of the above

**Explanation:**
*   **Simple Hinge Articulator:** This type of articulator only allows for a simple opening and closing motion around a fixed hinge. It **cannot** reproduce lateral (side-to-side) or protrusive movements.
*   **Interference Detection:**
    *   Because it cannot perform lateral movements, it **cannot detect working or non-working side interferences**.
    *   Because it cannot perform protrusive movements, it cannot detect protrusive interferences.
    *   It can only detect interferences that occur during the final arc of closure into maximum intercuspation. These are called **centric interferences**. An incisor interference that prevents the posterior teeth from occluding in centric *can* be detected on a simple hinge articulator.

---

### Question 52:
Which of the following is an advantage of a removable functional appliance (e.g., Twin Block) over a fixed functional appliance (e.g., Herbst)?
A. They allow the simultaneous use of orthodontic brackets.
B. They hold the mandible in a protrusive position to stimulate condylar growth.
**C. They allow selective guided eruption of posterior teeth.**
D. They do not require good patient compliance.

**Explanation:**
*   **Correct Advantage (C):** Removable appliances like the Twin Block have acrylic that covers the occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth. By selectively grinding away the acrylic over certain teeth (e.g., the lower molars), the clinician can **guide their eruption** vertically. This is a powerful tool for correcting deep bites by allowing the posterior teeth to erupt and "open" the bite. This cannot be done with a fixed appliance like the Herbst.
*   **Why others are incorrect:**
    *   **(A)** Fixed appliances (Herbst) are used simultaneously with brackets. Removable appliances generally are not.
    *   **(B)** *Both* types of appliances hold the mandible forward to stimulate growth; this is their shared function, not an advantage of one over the other.
    *   **(D)** Removable appliances require **excellent patient compliance**, whereas fixed appliances are non-removable and work 24/7, making them compliance-free. This is a major advantage of fixed appliances, not removable ones.

### Question 53:
A patient was treated for Stage III, Grade B periodontitis. After Phase I therapy, they return with no bleeding, but still have some 5mm pockets. What is the most appropriate periodontal diagnosis at this point?
A. Gingival health on a reduced periodontium
B. Stage I, Grade A periodontitis
**C. Stage III, Grade B periodontitis, stable.**
D. Stage II, Grade B periodontitis

**Explanation:**
This question tests the 2017 classification of periodontal diseases.
*   **Staging Does Not Regress:** The **Stage** of periodontitis is based on the severity of disease at its worst point, primarily determined by the maximum amount of historical bone loss and attachment loss. This damage is largely irreversible. Therefore, a patient diagnosed with Stage III will **always remain a Stage III patient** (or progress to Stage IV). The stage cannot be retrograded to Stage II or I. The goal of treatment is to make the disease stable.
*   **Grading Can Change:** The **Grade** reflects the rate of progression and presence of risk factors (like smoking or diabetes). If risk factors are controlled, the grade can improve (e.g., from C to B, or B to A). In this case, no information suggests the grade has changed.
*   **Conclusion:** The patient was Stage III, Grade B. After successful initial therapy, they are now a **stable Stage III, Grade B periodontitis patient**.

### Question 54:
The potency of a local anesthetic is primarily influenced by which of the following factors?
A. Protein binding
B. pKa
**C. Lipid solubility**
D. pH of the tissue

**Explanation:**
The intrinsic properties of a local anesthetic molecule determine its clinical characteristics.
*   **Potency (C):** Potency is determined by **lipid solubility**. The nerve membrane is a lipid bilayer. A more lipid-soluble drug can more easily penetrate this membrane to reach its site of action (sodium channels) inside the nerve. Therefore, higher lipid solubility equals higher potency.
*   **Duration (A):** Duration of action is primarily determined by **protein binding**. Once inside the nerve, the drug binds to proteins near the sodium channel. A higher degree of protein binding keeps the drug at the site of action for longer, increasing its duration.
*   **Onset (B):** Onset of action is primarily determined by **pKa**. A drug's pKa determines the proportion of ionized vs. non-ionized molecules at physiologic pH. The non-ionized (base) form is what crosses the nerve membrane. A pKa closer to physiologic pH means more base molecules are available, leading to a faster onset.

### Question 55:
In normal maximum intercuspation, the mesial marginal ridge of a maxillary second premolar contacts which of the following?
A. Distal marginal ridge of the mandibular first premolar.
**B. Distal marginal ridge of the mandibular second premolar.**
C. Mesial marginal ridge of the mandibular first molar.
D. Central fossa of the mandibular second premolar.

**Explanation:**
This requires knowledge of normal occlusal relationships. In a Class I occlusion, each maxillary tooth occludes with its mandibular counterpart and the tooth distal to it, with two exceptions.
*   The general rule is that a specific cusp or ridge of a maxillary tooth will contact the corresponding feature on the mandibular tooth that is one tooth "ahead" of it numerically.
*   Following this pattern, the **mesial marginal ridge of the maxillary second premolar (#15 or #25)** will occlude with the **distal marginal ridge of the mandibular second premolar (#45 or #35)**.
*   Drawing a "picket fence" diagram is a helpful way to visualize these relationships.

### Question 56:
Which of the following is true regarding a Process Challenge Device (PCD) used in the sterilization process?
A. It should be used only in the first sterilization cycle of the day.
B. It allows for the removal of air from the sterilizer to allow steam penetration.
**C. It should be used with a chemical indicator of Type 5 or 6, and/or a biological indicator in the center of the device.**
D. It is only required for sterilizers that use a vacuum cycle.

**Explanation:**
A PCD is designed to be the most difficult item to sterilize in a load, thus "challenging" the sterilization process.
*   **Correct Statement (C):** A PCD, whether commercially made or created in-house, must contain a sterilization monitor deep inside it. This should be a high-level **Type 5 or 6 chemical indicator** (which integrates time, temperature, and steam) and/or a **biological indicator** (spore test). If this indicator inside the most challenging device changes appropriately, it gives confidence that everything else in the load was also sterilized.
*   **Why others are false:**
    *   **(A)** A PCD is used in **every sterilization cycle**, not just the first one. The first cycle of the day must contain a PCD with a *biological indicator*. Subsequent cycles must contain a PCD with a *chemical indicator*.
    *   **(B)** This describes the function of a pre-vacuum cycle in an autoclave. A test called the Bowie-Dick test is used to check the efficacy of the air removal, which is different from a PCD.
*   This question was noted as flawed because another option (related to its use in the first cycle) was also presented as correct in the transcript, but (C) describes its fundamental composition and purpose.

---

### Question 57:
Which of the following statements is true regarding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in endodontic infections?
A. They are potent endotoxins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
**B. They are susceptible to inactivation by calcium hydroxide.**
C. They cause inflammation, but not periapical inflammation.
D. They stimulate osteoblast activation.

**Explanation:**
LPS is a major virulence factor in endodontic disease.
*   **Correct Statement (B):** Calcium hydroxide is a commonly used intracanal medicament precisely because of its ability to inactivate LPS. The very high pH (alkalinity) of calcium hydroxide hydrolyzes and detoxifies the Lipid A portion of the LPS molecule, which is responsible for its inflammatory effects.
*   **Why others are false:**
    *   **(A)** LPS is a component of the outer membrane of **gram-negative bacteria**, not gram-positive.
    *   **(C)** LPS is a powerful inflammatory mediator that is a primary cause of **periapical inflammation** and bone resorption.
    *   **(D)** LPS stimulates an inflammatory cascade that leads to **osteoclast** activation (bone resorption), not osteoblast activation (bone formation).

### Question 58:
If an orthodontic bracket is placed too gingivally on the buccal surface of a tooth, it will most likely result in:
A. Intrusion and lingual tipping
B. Intrusion and buccal tipping
C. Extrusion and buccal tipping
**D. Extrusion and lingual tipping**

**Explanation:**
The archwire always tries to straighten and level itself. The position of the bracket relative to the tooth's center of resistance determines the movement.
*   **Bracket placed too gingivally:** The archwire sits gingival to its ideal path. To straighten out, the wire will apply an **extrusive force** to the tooth, pulling it down into the line of the archwire.
*   **Tipping:** Since the force is applied gingival to the center of resistance, it will also create a moment that causes the crown to tip. An extrusive force applied to the buccal surface will cause the crown to tip **lingually**.
*   **The reverse:** If the bracket were placed too incisally, it would cause intrusion and buccal tipping.

---

### Question 59:
Which of the following statements regarding silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is false?
A. It can be used in patients with cavitated smooth surface lesions.
**B. It is not effective when used with non-cavitated occlusal carious lesions.**
C. It is a clear-to-brown liquid with a strong ammonia odor.
D. It causes discoloration of the treated tooth structure.

**Explanation:**
The question asks for the **false** statement.
*   **Statement B is False:** The statement claims SDF is "not effective" on non-cavitated lesions. This is incorrect. While its most dramatic use is in arresting cavitated lesions, SDF is also highly effective at arresting **non-cavitated** incipient lesions due to the high concentration of both silver (antimicrobial) and fluoride (remineralizing). Therefore, the statement that it is *not effective* is false.
*   **Why others are true:**
    *   (A) SDF is a primary treatment for arresting cavitated lesions, especially in pediatric or special needs patients.
    *   (C) This accurately describes its physical properties.
    *   (D) The most significant side effect of SDF is that it stains the carious tooth structure black.

### Question 60:
The mother of a 6-year-old child is concerned about a "double row" of teeth in the lower front. The permanent mandibular central incisors are erupting lingual to the primary centrals, which are mobile and have ~1/4 of their root remaining. There is no crowding. What is the most appropriate management?
**A. Reassure the parent that this is a normal variation of eruption.**
B. Extract the primary central incisors.
C. Place an appliance to push the permanent teeth labially.
D. Monitor for 6 months, then extract if not resolved.

**Explanation:**
This is a very common clinical scenario.
*   **Eruption Pattern:** It is very common for the permanent mandibular incisors to erupt lingually to the primary incisors.
*   **Key Positive Signs:** The primary teeth are **mobile** and show significant **root resorption**. This indicates that the natural exfoliation process is proceeding normally.
*   **Management:** In the absence of crowding, and when the primary teeth are mobile, no intervention is necessary. The pressure from the tongue will typically guide the permanent incisors forward into their correct position after the primary teeth exfoliate.
*   **Guidelines:** Intervention (extraction of the primary teeth) is generally only considered if the condition persists past the age of **7.5 years**, or if the primary teeth show no signs of resorption or mobility, preventing the permanent teeth from moving into place. Since the child is 6, it is far too early to intervene.

### Question 61:
A study examined individuals of low socioeconomic status and their complaints about the high cost of dentistry. The odds ratio (OR) was 1.45 with a 95% confidence interval of (1.2 - 1.8). Which is the most appropriate interpretation?
A. There is a 45% increase in individuals of low socioeconomic status to complain about the high cost of dentistry.
B. There is a 55% decrease in individuals of low socioeconomic status to complain about the high cost of dentistry.
C. There is a 145% increase in individuals of low socioeconomic status to complain about the high cost of dentistry.
D. The results are not statistically significant.

**Explanation:**
Interpreting an odds ratio (OR) involves two steps: assessing significance and quantifying the effect.
1.  **Statistical Significance:** The 95% confidence interval (1.2 to 1.8) **does not include 1.0**. This means the result is statistically significant.
2.  **Direction of Association:** The OR is 1.45, which is **greater than 1.0**. This indicates a **positive association**, meaning the "exposed" group (low socioeconomic status) is *more likely* to have the outcome (complain about cost).
3.  **Quantifying the Increase:** To convert the OR to a percentage increase, the formula is:
    *   Percentage Increase = (OR - 1) × 100
    *   Percentage Increase = (1.45 - 1) × 100
    *   Percentage Increase = 0.45 × 100 = **45%**

### Question 62:
A biopsy from the anterior maxilla shows enlarged eosinophilic epithelial cells without nuclei, referred to as "ghost cells." Where are these seen?
A. Gorlin-Goltz syndrome
B. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT)
C. Regional odontodysplasia
**D. Gorlin cyst**

**Explanation:**
*   **Ghost Cells:** These are a specific and characteristic histopathologic finding. They are aberrant keratinized cells that are swollen, eosinophilic, and have lost their nuclei.
*   **Gorlin Cyst:** This is the eponym for a **Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst (COC)**. The presence of ghost cells is the pathognomonic (defining) feature of a COC.
*   **Other Options:**
    *   AOT is characterized by duct-like or glandular structures.
    *   Regional odontodysplasia is also known as "ghost teeth" because of the radiographic appearance of the teeth themselves, but this is different from the histologic "ghost cells."
    *   Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is associated with multiple odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs) and other systemic findings, not COCs.

### Question 63:
A metal framework for an RPD is returned from the lab. During try-in on the master cast, it rocks and only fully seats on one side. What is the most likely cause?
A. Inaccurate final impression
B. Inaccurate occlusal record
C. Distortion of the impression material
**D. Distortion of the metal framework during processing**

**Explanation:**
The key is to determine if the error occurred in the clinic (dentist's fault) or the lab.
*   **The Test:** The framework **does not fit the master cast**.
*   **Conclusion:** The master cast is the direct positive replica of the final impression. If the framework doesn't fit the cast it was made on, then the error occurred *after* the cast was created. This points directly to a laboratory error. The most likely cause is that the **metal framework itself was warped or distorted during the casting, finishing, or polishing procedures in the lab**.
*   **Contrast:** If the framework fit the master cast perfectly but did not fit in the patient's mouth, the error would most likely be a distorted impression or an inaccurate cast, which is the dentist's responsibility.

### Question 64:
All of the following are expected to cause hypokalemia (low potassium) EXCEPT:
**A. Metabolic acidosis**
B. Increased plasma insulin
C. Excess aldosterone secretion
D. Beta-adrenergic stimulation of cells

**Explanation:**
This question asks which condition causes hyperkalemia (high potassium), while the others cause hypokalemia.
*   **Metabolic Acidosis (A):** In an acidotic state, there is an excess of hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood. To buffer this, H+ ions move from the blood into the body's cells. To maintain electrical neutrality, potassium ions (K+) must then move **out of the cells** and into the blood. This shift results in **hyperkalemia**.
*   **Causes of Hypokalemia (B, C, D):**
    *   **Insulin (B):** Insulin stimulates the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which actively drives potassium **into** cells, lowering plasma potassium.
    *   **Aldosterone (C):** Aldosterone acts on the kidneys to increase sodium reabsorption and **increase potassium excretion**, leading to potassium loss from the body.
    *   **Beta-adrenergic stimulation (D):** Similar to insulin, stimulating beta-2 receptors activates the Na+/K+ pump, shifting potassium **into** cells.

### Question 65:
A patient returns three months after a traumatic surgical extraction of #38 complaining of persistent numbness on the lateral side of the tongue. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?
A. Prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.
B. Initiate nerve mapping to establish a baseline.
C. Take a cone-beam CT scan.
**D. Assess the patient for nerve grafting/surgical repair.**

**Explanation:**
The timing of the patient's presentation is the critical factor.
*   **The Situation:** The patient presents **three months post-op** with **persistent numbness** and no indication of improvement. The window for spontaneous recovery or simple monitoring has passed.
*   **Management at 3 Months:**
    *   **Nerve Mapping Baseline (B):** It is too late to establish a "baseline." A baseline should have been taken immediately post-op. At three months, the lack of improvement is the key finding.
    *   **Corticosteroids (A):** These are used to manage acute inflammation in the immediate post-op period. They will have no effect on a potential nerve transection three months later.
    *   **Surgical Intervention (D):** Three months of persistent, severe anesthesia with no improvement is a strong indication of significant nerve damage, likely a neuroma or complete transection (neurotmesis). At this point, the patient should be evaluated for microsurgical nerve repair to have any chance of regaining function. This is the only proactive treatment option left.

### Question 66:
A maxillary canine is planned to receive a full-coverage crown with subgingival margins. There are no signs of inflammation, but there is only 1mm of attached gingiva. Which is the most appropriate procedure prior to crown placement?
A. Root planing
B. Coronally positioned flap
C. Localized gingivectomy
**D. Autogenous connective tissue graft**

**Explanation:**
Placing a subgingival restoration margin requires an adequate zone of keratinized/attached gingiva to withstand the restorative trauma and maintain health. This is known as "biotype modification."
*   **The Guideline:** A minimum of 3mm of attached gingiva and 5mm of total keratinized gingiva is recommended when placing subgingival margins.
*   **The Problem:** This patient only has 1mm of attached gingiva, which is insufficient.
*   **The Solution:** A procedure is needed to **increase the zone of attached gingiva**.
    *   An **autogenous connective tissue graft (or a free gingival graft)** is the procedure of choice for this purpose. It involves transplanting keratinized tissue from the palate to the recipient site to widen the band of attached gingiva.
*   **Incorrect Options:** A gingivectomy *removes* gingiva. A coronally positioned flap *moves* existing gingiva but does not create more, and is contraindicated with insufficient keratinized tissue.

### Question 67:
Which statement is correct regarding anxiolytic and hypnotic agents?
A. Phenobarbital shows analgesic properties.
B. Barbiturates are contraindicated in acute intermittent porphyria.
C. Diazepam is a microsomal enzyme inducer.
D. Zaleplon is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system.

**Explanation:**
*   **Correct Statement (B):** Barbiturates (like phenobarbital) are known to induce the ALA synthase enzyme. In patients with acute intermittent porphyria, this induction exacerbates the condition by increasing the production of porphyrin precursors, which can trigger a life-threatening attack. This is an absolute contraindication.
*   **Why others are false:**
    *   **(A)** Barbiturates have sedative and hypnotic properties but **no analgesic properties**. They can even increase the perception of pain (anti-analgesic).
    *   **(C)** Diazepam (a benzodiazepine) is *metabolized* by the P450 system, but it is not a significant inducer. Barbiturates are the classic potent enzyme inducers.
    *   **(D)** This statement is also true, Zaleplon is metabolized by P450. The instructor likely accepted B as the intended key answer because it represents a critical clinical contraindication, a more common testing point. *[Note: The transcript mentions multiple correct options in the source material, a common issue in mock exams.]*

### Question 68:
Which statement regarding enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) used in periodontal regeneration is correct?
A. They can only be used in conjunction with a membrane.
**B. They have been shown to be effective in cementum regeneration.**
C. Significant bone fill is evident in cases of horizontal bone loss.
D. All of the above.

**Explanation:**
EMD (e.g., Emdogain) is a biologic agent used to stimulate periodontal regeneration.
*   **Correct Statement (B):** Histologic studies have confirmed that EMD effectively stimulates the regeneration of all parts of the periodontium, including **new cementum**, new alveolar bone, and a new periodontal ligament. Its ability to promote cementum formation is a key part of achieving true regeneration.
*   **Why others are false:**
    *   **(A)** The addition of a barrier membrane **confers no additional benefit** when using EMD. EMD works by stimulating cellular differentiation, a different mechanism than the space maintenance provided by a membrane in GTR.
    *   **(C)** Periodontal regeneration techniques, including EMD, are only effective for treating **vertical or infrabony defects**. They are **not effective** for treating generalized horizontal bone loss.

---

### Question 69:
A patient is having a root canal done. After placement of a rubber dam, the patient develops a rash, flushing, and angioedema. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Vasovagal syncope
B. Delayed-type hypersensitivity
**C. Rapid-onset skin reaction (Type I Hypersensitivity)**
D. Anaphylactic reaction

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The patient is experiencing an acute allergic reaction. The signs (rash, flushing, angioedema) are classic manifestations. The key is the timing and the systems involved.
*   **Timing:** The reaction happened immediately after the placement of the rubber dam, suggesting an allergy to latex.
*   **Type of Reaction:**
    *   This is a **Type I (Immediate) Hypersensitivity reaction**. It is a rapid-onset skin reaction.
    *   It is **not an anaphylactic reaction** because there are no signs of respiratory (e.g., wheezing, bronchospasm) or cardiovascular (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia) collapse mentioned. Anaphylaxis is a systemic, life-threatening Type I reaction.
    *   It is **not contact dermatitis**, which is a Type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity that takes hours or days to develop.

---

### Question 70:
What is the primary cause of an anterior open bite in a patient with a Le Fort I fracture?
**A. Posterior and inferior displacement of the maxilla due to pull from the pterygoid muscles.**
B. Upward traction of the maxilla by the muscles of facial expression.
C. Downward and backward rotation of the mandible by the infrahyoid muscles.
D. Fracture of the mandibular condyles.

**Explanation:**
*   **Le Fort I Fracture:** This is a horizontal fracture that separates the maxilla (from the nasal floor down) from the rest of the midface.
*   **Muscle Pull:** The medial and lateral pterygoid muscles originate from the skull base and insert onto the mandible and the fractured maxillary segment. When the maxilla is fractured, the powerful pull of these muscles displaces the now-mobile segment **downward and backward (inferiorly and posteriorly)**.
*   **Occlusal Result:** This displacement causes the posterior maxillary teeth to contact the mandibular teeth prematurely, leaving a gap in the anterior. This is clinically evident as an **anterior open bite**. The muscles of facial expression (B) are too weak to cause this bony movement.

---

### Question 71:
A leukemic patient received a bone marrow transplant 20 days ago. He presents with an erythematous buccal mucosa. Which of the following should NOT be considered as a differential diagnosis?
A. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection
**C. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**
D. Candidiasis

**Explanation:**
The key is understanding the patient's immune status.
*   **Patient Status:** A patient who has just received a bone marrow transplant is **profoundly immunosuppressed**, both from their underlying leukemia and from the high-dose chemo/radiation used to ablate their old marrow.
*   **Differential Diagnosis for Oral Lesions:**
    *   **GVHD (A):** This is a very common complication where the new, donor immune cells attack the recipient's tissues. The oral mucosa is a frequent target.
    *   **HSV (B) and Candidiasis (D):** These are opportunistic infections that flourish in an immunosuppressed host.
    *   **SLE (C):** Systemic lupus erythematosus is an **autoimmune disease**, where the body's own immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks itself. This condition would be suppressed, not caused, by the profound immunosuppression the patient is undergoing. Therefore, SLE should not be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Question 72:
Damage to the trochlear nerve nucleus will result in which of the following deficits?
A. Ipsilateral paralysis of the superior oblique muscle.
**B. Contralateral paralysis of the superior oblique muscle.**
C. Ipsilateral paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle.
D. Contralateral paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle.

**Explanation:**
The trochlear nerve (Cranial Nerve IV) has a unique anatomical path.
*   **Function:** It innervates a single muscle: the **superior oblique muscle** of the eye.
*   **Unique Feature:** The axons from the trochlear nerve nucleus **decussate (cross over to the opposite side)** within the brainstem before they exit.
*   **Clinical Implication:**
    *   A lesion of the **trochlear nerve nucleus** on one side will cause paralysis of the superior oblique muscle on the **contralateral (opposite)** side.
    *   A lesion of the **trochlear nerve itself** (after it has exited the brainstem) will cause paralysis on the **ipsilateral (same)** side.

### Question 73:
Changes in the arch length of the mandible during the transition from primary to permanent dentition will be in the form of:
A. An increase of 2-3 mm
**B. A decrease of 2-3 mm**
C. An increase of 6 mm
D. No significant change

**Explanation:**
Arch length (or depth) is the distance from a midpoint between the central incisors to a line tangent to the distal surfaces of the second primary molars.
*   **Mandibular Arch:** In the mandible, the space gained from the permanent incisors being more proclined is not enough to offset the space lost due to the mesial drift of the permanent first molars into the **leeway space**.
*   **Leeway Space:** This is the size difference between the primary canine/molars and the permanent canine/premolars that replace them. The mandibular leeway space is approximately 2.5 mm per side.
*   **Net Result:** As the permanent molars drift mesially to close this space, the overall arch length decreases by an average of **2-3 mm**.

---

### Question 74:
A 35-year-old patient presents with numbness over the lower lip, chin, and anterior two-thirds of the tongue following mandibular surgery. The affected nerve enters the skull through which of the following foramina?
A. Foramen spinosum
B. Foramen rotundum
**C. Foramen ovale**
D. Jugular foramen

**Explanation:**
The question requires identifying the nerve responsible and its cranial exit point.
*   **Nerve Identification:**
    *   Numbness of the lower lip and chin is due to injury to the **mental nerve/inferior alveolar nerve**.
    *   Numbness (general sensation) of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue is due to injury to the **lingual nerve**.
*   **Cranial Nerve Origin:** Both the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve are branches of the **mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3)**.
*   **Cranial Foramen:** The mandibular nerve (V3) exits the skull through the **foramen ovale**.

### Question 75:
While removing a large mandibular torus, the mucoperiosteal elevator accidentally slips towards the floor of the mouth. Which of the following structures is most likely to be injured?
A. Lingual artery
B. Lingual nerve
**C. Sublingual gland**
D. Mylohyoid muscle

**Explanation:**
This question is about the anatomy of the floor of the mouth in the premolar region, where tori are common.
*   **Anatomical Relationships:** The structure that lies most immediately adjacent to the lingual aspect of the mandible in the premolar area is the **sublingual gland**. It sits in the sublingual fossa, directly deep to the mucosa of the floor of the mouth.
*   **Lingual Nerve Path:** The lingual nerve runs more posteriorly. It is in close contact with the mandible in the third molar region, but as it travels anteriorly, it moves medially (inward), away from the mandible and towards the tongue, passing superior to the submandibular duct.
*   **Conclusion:** An instrument slipping directly off the bone in the premolar torus region would most likely perforate the thin mucosa and enter the sublingual gland.

### Question 76:
A 6-year-old child has a primary first molar with a pulpotomy. During a recall, a bitewing shows an interproximal radiolucency on the distal aspect of the tooth. What is the most appropriate management?
A. Observe and monitor.
B. Endodontic retreatment of the primary molar.
C. Restore with a Class II composite restoration.
**D. Extraction of the primary first molar.**

**Explanation:**
A pulpotomy is considered to have failed if there are signs of subsequent pathology.
*   **The Finding:** The development of a new carious lesion on a tooth that has already had a pulpotomy indicates a high likelihood of bacterial leakage and failure of the pulpotomy medicament.
*   **Prognosis of Retreatment:** Re-treating a primary molar pulpotomy or attempting a pulpectomy on a previously treated tooth has a very poor prognosis. The tooth is considered non-restorable from a pulpal health perspective.
*   **Management:** The standard of care for a failed pulpotomy in a primary molar is **extraction**, followed by placement of a space maintainer if necessary (in this case, a band and loop would be needed to hold the space for the erupting first premolar).

### Question 77:
A 7-year-old patient weighing 20kg received three cartridges of 4% prilocaine. Shortly after, the patient appeared drowsy and disoriented. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Allergic reaction
B. Methemoglobinemia
**C. Local anesthetic overdose**
D. Syncope

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The signs (drowsiness, disorientation) following the administration of a large amount of local anesthetic are classic central nervous system (CNS) symptoms of an **overdose**.
*   **Toxicity Progression:** LA toxicity typically manifests first with CNS excitation (restlessness, tremors), followed by CNS depression (drowsiness, disorientation, loss of consciousness). In children, the excitatory phase can be very brief or absent, and they may proceed directly to CNS depression.
*   **Calculation Check:**
    *   Maximum dose for prilocaine is ~6 mg/kg.
    *   Patient weight = 20 kg. Max dose = 20 kg * 6 mg/kg = 120 mg.
    *   Dose administered: 3 cartridges * 1.8 mL/cartridge * 40 mg/mL = 216 mg.
    *   The patient received almost double the maximum recommended dose, confirming an overdose.
*   **Methemoglobinemia (B):** This is a specific risk with high doses of prilocaine, but its primary sign is cyanosis (bluish skin) that doesn't respond to oxygen. While possible, the CNS signs point more directly to a general overdose.

### Question 78:
The removal of which of the following impactions is associated with an increased risk of injury to the inferior alveolar nerve?
A. Mesioangular
B. Distoangular
**C. Horizontal**
D. Vertical

**Explanation:**
The risk of nerve injury is related to the proximity of the tooth roots to the nerve canal and the amount of bone removal required for extraction.
*   **Horizontal Impaction:** In a horizontal impaction, the crown of the third molar is often directly over the nerve canal, and the roots are frequently superimposed on or in direct contact with the nerve.
*   **Surgical Difficulty:** To remove a horizontal impaction, the surgeon must remove a significant amount of buccal and distal bone, often deep into the mandible, to expose the tooth for sectioning. This deep drilling and sectioning places the bur in very close proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve, creating the highest risk of direct trauma.
*   While a distoangular impaction can be the most difficult to elevate, the horizontal impaction carries the highest risk of iatrogenic nerve injury during bone removal and tooth sectioning.

### Question 79:
A 9-year-old boy suddenly stops talking, develops a blank stare, and exhibits rapid blinking for 10-15 seconds, then immediately resumes normal activity. What type of seizure is this?
**A. Absence seizure**
B. Myoclonic seizure
C. Tonic-clonic seizure
D. Focal seizure

**Explanation:**
This is the textbook description of an **absence seizure** (formerly known as "petit mal").
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Sudden, brief lapse of consciousness.
    *   Patient has a "blank stare" and is unresponsive.
    *   Automatisms like rapid blinking or lip smacking are common.
    *   The episode lasts only a few seconds.
    *   There is an abrupt onset and an abrupt cessation, with no post-ictal confusion (the person immediately returns to normal).
*   This is a type of generalized seizure most common in childhood.

### Question 80:
Which of the following statements is true regarding masticatory space infections?
A. Mandibular second premolars are the most frequent source of infection.
**B. The submasseteric space is the most commonly involved space.**
C. Infection spreads from the maxillary teeth via the buccal space.
D. The most common cause is pericoronitis around a mandibular premolar.

**Explanation:**
The masticatory space is a group of fascial spaces associated with the muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, medial and lateral pterygoids).
*   **Most Common Source:** The most frequent source of infection is a periapical abscess of a **mandibular third molar**.
*   **Most Commonly Involved Space (B):** Infections from mandibular third molars tend to spread into the contiguous spaces. The **submasseteric space**, which lies between the masseter muscle and the lateral aspect of the ramus, is the most commonly involved component of the masticatory space.
*   **Why others are false:**
    *   (A, D) The source is mandibular molars (especially third molars), not premolars.
    *   (C) Maxillary teeth infections spread to other spaces (e.g., buccal, canine, infratemporal), not typically the primary masticatory spaces.

### Question 81:
A patient loses consciousness. Their respiratory rate is 14 breaths/min, and their pulse is 40 beats/min. What is the first thing to be performed?
A. Chest compressions
**B. Airway management (ensure a patent airway)**
C. Rescue breaths
D. Call 911

**Explanation:**
This is a question about the sequence of basic life support (BLS).
*   **Assessment:**
    *   The patient is unconscious.
    *   They are **breathing** (rate is 14/min, which is normal).
    *   They have a **pulse** (rate is 40/min, which is bradycardic but present).
*   **BLS Algorithm:** The priority is always A-B-C (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).
    *   **Airway (B):** Since the patient is unconscious, their tongue may obstruct their airway. The first and most critical step is to ensure a patent airway, typically by performing a **head-tilt, chin-lift** maneuver.
*   **Why others are incorrect:**
    *   **Chest compressions (A):** Are only performed if there is **no pulse**.
    *   **Rescue breaths (C):** Are only performed if the patient is **not breathing**.
    *   Calling 911 is essential, but the immediate, hands-on action is to secure the airway.

### Question 82:
A patient treated for periodontitis one year ago returns for recall. Examination shows normal probing depths, generalized recession, and no bleeding on probing. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?
A. Clinical gingival health on an intact periodontium
**B. Clinical gingival health on a reduced periodontium**
C. Gingivitis on a reduced periodontium
D. Stage I periodontitis

**Explanation:**
This question uses the 2017 classification system.
*   **Key Findings:** The patient is **healthy** (no inflammation, no bleeding) but has a history of periodontitis, which is evident by the **generalized recession** (a sign of past attachment loss).
*   **The Diagnosis:**
    *   The periodontium is **"reduced"** because it has lost bone and attachment due to the previous disease. It is not "intact."
    *   The current state is **"clinical gingival health"** because there are no signs of active inflammation.
*   **Conclusion:** The correct diagnosis is **clinical gingival health on a reduced periodontium**. This is the goal of successful periodontal therapy for a periodontitis patient.

### Question 83:
Which of the following drug combinations has the highest risk for developing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ)?
A. Alendronate and amlodipine
**B. Denosumab and zoledronic acid**
C. Alendronate and hydrochlorothiazide
D. Denosumab and metformin

**Explanation:**
The risk of MRONJ is highest with potent, long-acting anti-resorptive medications, especially when used in combination or given intravenously for cancer therapy.
*   **Denosumab (Prolia/Xgeva):** A RANKL inhibitor, a very potent anti-resorptive agent.
*   **Zoledronic Acid (Reclast/Zometa):** A nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, the most potent bisphosphonate, often given intravenously.
*   **The Combination (B):** Using two different classes of powerful anti-resorptive agents, often in the higher doses used for oncology patients, creates a cumulative and significantly elevated risk for developing MRONJ compared to using a single oral agent like Alendronate for osteoporosis.

### Question 84:
Which of the following is the appropriate prophylactic dose of azithromycin for a pediatric patient with a penicillin allergy?
A. 50 mg/kg
B. 25 mg/kg
**C. 15 mg/kg**
D. 10 mg/kg

**Explanation:**
This is a direct recall of the antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis.
*   **Standard Regimen (No Allergy):** Amoxicillin 50 mg/kg.
*   **Penicillin Allergy:** If a patient is allergic to penicillin, one of the alternative options is azithromycin.
*   **Pediatric Dose for Azithromycin:** The correct prophylactic dose is **15 mg/kg**, given 30-60 minutes before the procedure. The maximum dose is 500 mg.

### Question 85:
Which statement accurately describes lingualized occlusion for complete dentures?
A. It simplifies occlusal setup by removing compensating curves.
**B. It balances chewing efficiency with reduced lateral dislodging forces.**
C. It enhances aesthetics through symmetrical anterior guidance.
D. It improves speech clarity via posterior teeth alignment.

**Explanation:**
Lingualized occlusion is a specific occlusal scheme designed to improve the stability of complete dentures.
*   **The Concept:** It uses a sharp maxillary lingual cusp occluding into a wide, shallow central fossa of a non-anatomic or semi-anatomic mandibular tooth. The maxillary buccal cusps are taken out of occlusion.
*   **The Advantages (B):**
    *   **Chewing Efficiency:** It maintains good chewing efficiency because a sharp cusp is still used for cutting food.
    *   **Reduced Lateral Forces:** By eliminating contacts on the buccal cusps, the potentially destabilizing lateral forces that occur during chewing are significantly reduced. The forces are focused vertically through the central fossa, which enhances denture stability.
*   Compensating curves (A) are still necessary to achieve protrusive balance. It has little to do with aesthetics (C) or speech (D).

### Question 86:
A patient with an implant has bleeding on probing, a 6mm probing depth, and radiographic bone loss confined to the coronal third of the implant. The patient has controlled diabetes and inconsistent oral hygiene. What is the most appropriate initial treatment?
A. Immediate implant removal.
B. Flap surgery with laser therapy.
**C. Non-surgical mechanical debridement and oral hygiene instruction.**
D. Systemic antibiotics and occlusal adjustment only.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The signs (bleeding, deep pockets, radiographic bone loss) are diagnostic of **peri-implantitis**.
*   **Initial Treatment:** The first step in managing peri-implantitis is always a **non-surgical approach**. This is analogous to Phase I therapy for periodontitis.
*   **The Procedure (C):** The goal is to remove the bacterial biofilm from the implant surface. This involves **mechanical debridement** using special instruments (e.g., titanium or plastic curettes, ultrasonic scalers with non-metallic tips) to clean the implant surface, along with reinforcing **oral hygiene instruction**.
*   Surgical intervention (B) is only considered if the non-surgical approach fails to resolve the inflammation. Immediate removal (A) is only for mobile, failed implants.

---

### Question 87:
A patient has inflammation around a mandibular implant with 4-5mm probing depths, but no suppuration or radiographic bone loss. What is the diagnosis?
A. Healthy peri-implant tissue
**B. Peri-implant mucositis**
C. Peri-implantitis
D. Failing implant

**Explanation:**
This question tests the definitions of peri-implant diseases.
*   **Peri-implant Mucositis:** This is a reversible inflammatory condition of the soft tissues surrounding an implant, analogous to gingivitis. It is characterized by **bleeding on probing and inflammation**, but crucially, there is **no progressive bone loss** beyond the initial crestal remodeling.
*   **Peri-implantitis:** This is characterized by inflammation *and* progressive bone loss.
*   **Conclusion:** Since there is inflammation (bleeding, edema) but no radiographic bone loss, the correct diagnosis is **peri-implant mucositis**.

---

### Question 88:
Which of the following best describes gestational mandibular body bone development?
**A. Intramembranous ossification**
B. Endochondral ossification
C. Calcification of Meckel's cartilage
D. Appositional growth on the condyle

**Explanation:**
The mandible develops through multiple mechanisms, but the body develops through a specific one.
*   **Mandibular Body:** The body of the mandible (the horizontal portion) develops via **intramembranous ossification**. Bone forms directly from a condensation of mesenchymal tissue that appears lateral to Meckel's cartilage.
*   **Meckel's Cartilage (C):** This acts as a scaffold for the developing mandible but, with minor exceptions, does **not** turn into the bone of the mandibular body itself; it largely degenerates.
*   **Endochondral Ossification (B, D):** The condyle, coronoid process, and symphysis develop later from secondary cartilages, which do undergo endochondral ossification to contribute to the growth of the ramus and chin. However, the initial formation of the body is intramembranous.

---

### Question 89:
A patient with congestive heart failure is prescribed metoprolol. Which statement best describes its therapeutic effect?
A. It is a non-selective beta-blocker that decreases afterload.
**B. It is a selective beta-1 receptor blocker that normalizes the heart's response to sympathetic stimulation.**
C. It increases actin-myosin cross-linking, which increases cardiac contractility.
D. It directly stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.

**Explanation:**
The use of beta-blockers in heart failure seems counterintuitive but is based on a specific physiological principle.
*   **Pathophysiology of CHF:** In chronic heart failure, the sympathetic nervous system is constantly over-activated to compensate for poor cardiac output. This chronic overstimulation of beta-1 receptors in the heart causes them to become **downregulated** (less responsive).
*   **Therapeutic Effect of Metoprolol (B):** Metoprolol is a **selective beta-1 blocker**. By blocking the receptors from the constant sympathetic barrage, it allows them to rest and **upregulate** or "re-sensitize" over time. This restores or **normalizes the heart's response to sympathetic stimulation**, making it more efficient in the long term and improving overall cardiac function and survival. It does not directly increase contractility (C); its long-term effect is to improve the efficiency of the existing system.

### Question 90:
A 45-year-old patient has a well-defined radiolucent lesion in the posterior mandible. A biopsy shows numerous multinucleated giant cells in a fibrous stroma. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Paget's disease of bone
B. Fibrous dysplasia
**C. Central giant cell granuloma (CGCG)**
D. Ossifying fibroma

**Explanation:**
The histological description is the key to the diagnosis.
*   **Central Giant Cell Granuloma (CGCG):** The pathognomonic histological feature of a CGCG is the presence of **numerous multinucleated giant cells** scattered throughout a vascular, fibrous connective tissue stroma. Radiographically, it appears as a well-defined unilocular or multilocular radiolucency.
*   **Other Options:**
    *   **Paget's Disease:** Histology shows a "mosaic pattern" of woven bone; radiographically, it has a "cotton wool" appearance in its later stages.
    *   **Fibrous Dysplasia:** Histology shows irregular trabeculae of woven bone in a fibrous stroma, often described as "Chinese characters"; radiographically, it has a "ground-glass" appearance.
    *   **Ossifying Fibroma:** Is a fibro-osseous lesion containing bone and cementum-like tissue, not primarily giant cells.

### Question 91:
Which antiviral medication acts by inhibiting neuraminidase, thereby preventing the release of newly formed viral particles from infected cells?
A. Acyclovir
**B. Oseltamivir**
C. Ganciclovir
D. Amantadine

**Explanation:**
This question tests the mechanism of action of different antivirals.
*   **Oseltamivir (Tamiflu):** This is the classic example of a **neuraminidase inhibitor**. Influenza viruses use the neuraminidase enzyme to cleave themselves from the host cell membrane after they have replicated. By inhibiting this enzyme, Oseltamivir "traps" the new virions on the surface of the infected cell, preventing their release and spread to other cells.
*   **Other MOAs:**
    *   **Acyclovir/Ganciclovir:** Are nucleoside analogues that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, causing chain termination.
    *   **Amantadine:** Blocks the M2 protein ion channel, interfering with viral uncoating.

---

### Question 92:
A patient has an unerupted maxillary permanent canine. The adjacent lateral incisor is retroclined and distally tilted. This most likely indicates:
A. Buccal impaction of the canine
**B. Palatal impaction of the canine**
C. Transposition of the canine and lateral incisor
D. Agenesis of the canine

**Explanation:**
The position of the lateral incisor is a key diagnostic clue for the location of an impacted canine.
*   **Palatal Impaction (B):** When a canine is impacted palatally, its eruption path is from the palatal and distal aspect. As it moves, it often contacts the **root** of the lateral incisor. This pressure on the root causes the crown of the lateral incisor to be tipped **distally** and flared **buccally (proclined)**. *[NOTE: The transcript incorrectly states retroclined, but the classic sign for palatal impaction is proclination/flaring of the lateral incisor. The distal tilt is correct.]*
*   **Buccal Impaction (A):** When a canine is impacted buccally, it is more likely to cause the lateral incisor root to move palatally, which can result in the crown tipping mesially or becoming retroclined.

Given the options and the common clinical signs, the distal tilt is the strongest indicator pointing toward a palatal impaction.

### Question 93:
For the surgical extraction of a badly decayed premolar, the dentist elevates a flap and removes buccal bone. What is the adequate amount of bone removal required?
A. Half the mesiodistal width and one-third the length of the root.
**B. Full mesiodistal width of the root and two-thirds the length of the root.**
C. Half the mesiodistal width and the full length of the root.
D. Full mesiodistal width and one-third the length of the root.

**Explanation:**
The goal of bone removal is to expose enough of the root to create a purchase point for an elevator and an unimpeded path for removal.
*   **Vertical Dimension:** Bone should be removed from the crest down approximately **one-half to two-thirds** the length of the root. This exposes enough root surface to apply an elevator effectively without having to go to the apex.
*   **Horizontal Dimension:** The bone removal should extend to the **full mesiodistal width** of the root. This creates a wide enough "trough" to allow the tooth to be luxated and removed buccally without being locked in by the mesial and distal bone.

---

### Question 94:
A dentist aims to reduce distortion in a periapical radiograph by adjusting the geometry of the paralleling technique. Which of the following contributes most effectively to minimizing distortion?
A. Decreasing the source-to-object distance.
B. Decreasing the object-to-receptor distance.
**C. Orienting the central ray perpendicular to both the tooth and the receptor.**
D. Placing the receptor close to the tooth regardless of the beam angle.

**Explanation:**
Radiographic distortion (elongation or foreshortening) is caused by incorrect alignment between the x-ray beam, the object (tooth), and the receptor.
*   **Rule of Perpendicularity (C):** To prevent distortion, the **central ray of the x-ray beam must be directed perpendicular to both the long axis of the tooth and the plane of the receptor**. The paralleling technique is designed to achieve this by placing the receptor parallel to the tooth and then directing the beam at a right angle to both.
*   **Magnification vs. Distortion:**
    *   Options A and B relate to **magnification and sharpness**, not distortion. Decreasing the object-receptor distance (B) reduces magnification. Increasing the source-object distance also reduces magnification.
    *   Distortion is purely an issue of angular relationships. Option D describes the bisecting angle technique, which inherently introduces distortion because the beam is not perpendicular to the tooth and receptor.

---

### Question 95:
Which of the following best explains why the rest is placed on the mesial surface of the terminal abutment in an RPI clasp assembly?
A. To convert a Class II lever into a Class I lever.
**B. To allow the retentive I-bar to disengage under functional loading.**
C. To prevent food impaction between the abutment and the prosthesis.
D. To reduce the impact of vertical occlusal forces on the abutment tooth.

**Explanation:**
The RPI (Rest, Plate, I-bar) system is a stress-releasing clasp design for distal extension RPDs.
*   **The Mechanism:** The rest is placed on the **mesial** fossa. The fulcrum line runs through this mesial rest. During function, when occlusal force is applied to the denture base, the denture rotates slightly into the tissue.
*   **The Disengagement (B):** Because the fulcrum is on the mesial, this rotation causes the retentive I-bar tip (located on the buccal surface, gingival to the height of contour) to move **downward and forward, into a deeper undercut**. This movement causes the clasp to **disengage** from the tooth surface, releasing any potentially harmful torquing forces on the abutment tooth.
*   This design converts a harmful Class I lever (which would occur with a distal rest) into a more favorable Class II lever. The primary reason for the mesial rest is to facilitate this stress-releasing movement.

### Question 96:
Which of the following statements describing lithium's properties is incorrect?
A. It is a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder.
B. It prevents the formation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) within the CNS.
**C. NSAIDs increase lithium excretion and decrease the effectiveness of lithium.**
D. Sodium restriction can result in lithium toxicity.

**Explanation:**
This question is about the pharmacology and drug interactions of lithium.
*   **Incorrect Statement (C):** This statement is the opposite of what actually happens. NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) can interfere with renal function and **decrease the renal excretion of lithium**. This leads to an **increase** in lithium plasma levels, which can easily cause **lithium toxicity**. Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index, making this a clinically significant interaction.
*   **Why others are correct:**
    *   (A) This is its primary clinical use.
    *   (B) This is its proposed mechanism of action.
    *   (D) The kidneys handle sodium and lithium in a similar way. If a patient is sodium-depleted (e.g., due to diuretics or a low-salt diet), the kidneys will try to conserve sodium and will inadvertently conserve lithium as well, leading to increased levels and potential toxicity.

---

### Question 97:
A 45-year-old patient presents for a routine exam. You observe bilateral white, reticular (lace-like) lesions on the buccal mucosa. The patient reports no pain. What is the most appropriate management?
**A. No treatment is required; observation is sufficient.**
B. Biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.
C. Prescription of topical corticosteroids.
D. Prescription of systemic corticosteroids.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The clinical description (bilateral, white, reticular/lacy lesions on the buccal mucosa) is pathognomonic for the **reticular form of oral lichen planus**.
*   **Management:**
    *   When the diagnosis is clinically obvious and the patient is **asymptomatic**, no treatment is required. The patient should be reassured and the lesions simply monitored at regular recall appointments.
    *   **Biopsy (B):** Is only indicated if the diagnosis is uncertain or if the lesion has an unusual appearance (e.g., ulcerative, non-healing) to rule out dysplasia or malignancy.
    *   **Corticosteroids (C, D):** Are only prescribed for the **symptomatic** forms of lichen planus (e.g., erosive or atrophic) to manage pain and inflammation.

---

### Question 98:
When fabricating a mandibular implant-supported overdenture, what is the minimum number of implants required for functional and stable support?
**A. 2**
B. 4
C. 6
D. 8

**Explanation:**
There are established guidelines for the number of implants needed to support an overdenture.
*   **Mandibular Overdenture:** The minimum standard of care for a mandibular overdenture is **two implants**, typically placed in the canine or premolar regions. These two implants provide significant improvement in retention and stability compared to a conventional denture.
*   **Maxillary Overdenture:** The maxilla has poorer bone quality and requires more support. The minimum number of implants for a maxillary overdenture is generally **four**.

---

### Question 99:
Which of the following is a terminal branch of the maxillary artery?
A. Inferior alveolar artery
B. Middle meningeal artery
**C. Sphenopalatine artery**
D. Superficial temporal artery

**Explanation:**
This is a question of pure anatomy of the external carotid artery system.
*   **External Carotid Artery:** The external carotid artery has several branches, and its two terminal branches are the **maxillary artery** and the **superficial temporal artery**.
*   **Maxillary Artery:** The maxillary artery is a major artery of the deep face. It travels through the infratemporal fossa and has many branches. Its own terminal branch, as it passes through the pterygopalatine fossa, is the **sphenopalatine artery**. This artery primarily supplies the nasal cavity.
*   Inferior alveolar and middle meningeal arteries are branches of the first part of the maxillary artery, not its terminal branch.

---

### Question 100:
During a cleaning appointment, a 24-year-old pregnant patient in her third trimester complains of feeling dizzy and then loses consciousness. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Hypoglycemia
B. Vasovagal syncope
**C. Supine hypotensive syndrome**
D. Partial seizure

**Explanation:**
*   **The Scenario:** A patient in late-stage pregnancy becomes syncopal while lying flat in the dental chair.
*   **Supine Hypotensive Syndrome:** This is the most likely cause. In the third trimester, the heavy, gravid uterus can compress the **inferior vena cava** when the patient is in the supine (lying flat on her back) position. This compression drastically reduces venous return to the heart, leading to a sudden drop in cardiac output and blood pressure, causing dizziness and syncope.
*   **Management:** The treatment is to immediately roll the patient onto her **left side**. This displaces the uterus off the inferior vena cava, restoring blood flow to the heart.


Here are day 2 questions.
Question 101 - 155 are not available. 
### Question 156:
What is the most appropriate flap design for the management of a periodontitis case associated with shallow interdental osseous craters in the right mandibular posterior sextant?
A. Split-thickness flap, undisplaced
B. Full-thickness flap, undisplaced
C. Split-thickness flap, apically displaced
**D. Full-thickness flap, apically displaced**

**Explanation:**
The treatment for shallow osseous craters is **ostectomy and osteoplasty** (bone recontouring), not guided tissue regeneration. The flap design must facilitate this procedure.
1.  **Full-thickness vs. Split-thickness:** Since the procedure involves direct manipulation and removal of bone, a **full-thickness flap** (including the periosteum) must be raised to fully expose the alveolar bone.
2.  **Apically displaced vs. Undisplaced:** After removing bone to create a more positive architecture, the soft tissue flap must be repositioned to match the new, more apical bone level. Therefore, the flap must be **apically displaced**. If it were left undisplaced, a deep pocket would re-form between the flap and the recontoured bone. The rule is: "soft tissue follows the bone."

### Question 157:
Which of the following drug properties is associated with high oral bioavailability?
A. Drugs with high first-pass metabolism
B. Highly hydrophilic drugs
**C. Highly lipophilic yet soluble in aqueous solutions**
D. Drugs that are extensively bound to plasma proteins

**Explanation:**
Oral bioavailability is the fraction of an orally administered drug that reaches systemic circulation. For high bioavailability, a drug must be both dissolved and absorbed.
*   **Correct Answer (C):** A drug that is **soluble in aqueous solutions** can dissolve in the gastric fluids. A drug that is **highly lipophilic** can then easily pass through the lipid membranes of the intestinal cells to be absorbed into the bloodstream. This combination is ideal for high oral bioavailability.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   (A) High first-pass metabolism means the drug is heavily metabolized by the liver after absorption, so very little reaches systemic circulation. This results in low bioavailability.
    *   (B) Highly hydrophilic (water-loving) drugs cannot easily cross the lipid cell membranes of the gut and are poorly absorbed.
    *   (D) Plasma protein binding affects a drug's *distribution* after it's already in the blood; it does not affect its initial bioavailability.

### Question 158:
Which of the following is correct regarding the autonomic nervous system?
A. Afferent neurons carry signals from the central nervous system (CNS) to effector organs.
B. The neurotransmitter at the parasympathetic ganglion is norepinephrine.
**C. The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic ganglion is acetylcholine.**
D. Sympathetic neurons release acetylcholine at the effector organs.
E. Parasympathetic neurons release norepinephrine at the effector organs.

**Explanation:**
This question tests the basic neurotransmitters of the ANS.
*   **Correct Answer (C):** At the **ganglion** (the synapse between the preganglionic and postganglionic neuron), the neurotransmitter for **both** the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems is **acetylcholine**.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   (A) **Afferent** neurons are sensory; they carry signals *to* the CNS. **Efferent** neurons carry signals *from* the CNS.
    *   (B) The neurotransmitter at the parasympathetic ganglion is acetylcholine.
    *   (D) Sympathetic postganglionic neurons release **norepinephrine** at most effector organs (with the exception of sweat glands, which use acetylcholine).
    *   (E) Parasympathetic postganglionic neurons release **acetylcholine** at the effector organs.

### Question 159:
Which of the following medications may increase the risk of digitalis (digoxin) toxicity?
**A. Chlorothiazide**
B. Spironolactone
C. Diazepam
D. Amiloride

**Explanation:**
Digoxin toxicity is famously potentiated by **hypokalemia** (low potassium).
*   **Mechanism:** Digoxin and potassium compete for the same binding site on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in cardiac cells. If potassium levels are low, there is less competition for digoxin, allowing more of it to bind to the pump. This leads to an exaggerated effect and potential toxicity.
*   **Diuretics and Potassium:**
    *   **Chlorothiazide** (a thiazide diuretic) and loop diuretics cause significant potassium loss in the urine, leading to hypokalemia.
    *   **Spironolactone** and **Amiloride** are **potassium-sparing diuretics**; they do not cause hypokalemia and are therefore safer to use with digoxin.
*   **Conclusion:** By causing hypokalemia, chlorothiazide increases the risk of digoxin toxicity.

### Question 160:
A patient is prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg for pain management following an extraction. Which instruction should be included?
A. Take one tablet orally q6h for 3 days.
B. Take one tablet orally q6h for 4 days.
C. Take one tablet orally q6h for 5 days.
**D. Take one tablet orally q6h PRN pain.**

**Explanation:**
The key principle in prescribing analgesics (painkillers) is that they should be taken only when needed.
*   **PRN (pro re nata):** This Latin term means "as the thing is needed" or simply "as needed."
*   **Rationale:** Analgesics are prescribed to manage pain. If the patient is not experiencing pain, they should not take the medication. Prescribing it for a fixed number of days (e.g., "for 5 days") implies the patient must take it for the full duration, regardless of their symptoms. This is inappropriate and leads to unnecessary medication use.
*   **Contrast with Antibiotics:** Antibiotics must be taken for the full prescribed course to ensure the infection is completely eradicated, even if the patient feels better. Analgesics are purely for symptom control.
*   **Special Cases:** For drugs like Ketorolac, you would still write "PRN pain" but add a limitation like "Do not use for more than 5 days."

### Question 161:
Which of the following patients requires surgical periodontal therapy?
A. A patient with poor oral hygiene and residual 6mm pockets 8 weeks post-SRP.
B. A patient with generalized recession, 2-3mm probing depths, and healthy gingiva.
C. A patient with gingivitis and a single 6mm pocket next to an overhanging restoration.
D. A patient with recession, bleeding, and a high frenal attachment.
**E. A periodontitis patient with good oral hygiene and residual 6-7mm pockets 8 weeks post-SRP.**

**Explanation:**
The absolute prerequisite for proceeding to surgical periodontal therapy is **excellent patient oral hygiene**.
*   **Correct Answer (E):** This patient meets all the criteria for surgery. They have undergone initial therapy (SRP), have demonstrated **good oral hygiene**, but still have **unresolved deep pockets**. This indicates that non-surgical therapy was insufficient to resolve the disease, and surgical access is now required.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   (A) This patient cannot have surgery because of their **poor oral hygiene**. They must undergo re-instruction and repeat non-surgical therapy first.
    *   (B) This patient is periodontally healthy on a reduced periodontium. There is no active disease, so no surgery is needed.
    *   (C) The primary problem is a local factor (overhang). The first step is to remove the overhang and perform scaling. Surgery is not the initial treatment.
    *   (D) The initial management is scaling to resolve the inflammation, and then addressing the frenum and recession.

### Question 162:
Which of the following best explains the role of guiding planes in the retention of a removable partial denture (RPD)?
A. Guiding planes have no contribution to the retention.
**B. Guiding planes enhance retention by limiting the path of removal.**
C. Guiding planes increase retention by providing mechanical undercuts.
D. Guiding planes ensure intimate contact with soft tissues.

**Explanation:**
Guiding planes are parallel surfaces prepared on abutment teeth that are contacted by the corresponding rigid guiding plates of the RPD framework.
*   **Primary Function:** Their main role is to define a single, specific **path of insertion and removal**.
*   **Contribution to Retention (B):** By creating only one path of removal, the guiding planes prevent the denture from being dislodged by forces coming from other directions (e.g., sticky foods pulling at an angle). The frictional contact between the parallel surfaces of the guiding planes and plates provides resistance to dislodgement along this single path, thus enhancing overall retention. This is often compared to the difficulty of opening a well-fitting box by lifting it straight up.
*   **Incorrect Option C:** Guiding planes do not engage undercuts. That is the sole function of the flexible retentive clasp arm.

### Question 163:
A patient needs restorations on teeth #46 (molar) and #34 (premolar). Which are the most appropriate anesthetic techniques to use in the same visit?
A. Bilateral inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB)
B. Bilateral incisive nerve block
C. Right IANB and left mental nerve block
**D. Right IANB and left incisive nerve block**

**Explanation:**
The goal is to achieve pulpal anesthesia for all teeth while minimizing patient discomfort.
*   **Right Side (#46):** A mandibular molar requires an **IANB**. There is no other reliable way to achieve pulpal anesthesia.
*   **Left Side (#34):** A mandibular premolar can be anesthetized pulapally by either an IANB or an **incisive nerve block**.
*   **Comparing Options:**
    *   **Bilateral IANB (A):** While effective, this is highly uncomfortable for the patient, leaving their entire tongue, chin, and both sides of their lower lip numb. It is generally avoided if possible.
    *   **Mental Nerve Block (C):** This only provides soft tissue anesthesia. It does **not** anesthetize the pulp of the tooth.
    *   **Right IANB and Left Incisive Nerve Block (D):** This is the best option. It provides the necessary anesthesia for the molar on the right side. On the left, it uses a more localized block (incisive) to anesthetize the premolar pulp without numbing the entire half of the mandible and tongue, making it much more comfortable for the patient.

### Question 164:
A 14-year-old has a molar with moderate dentinal caries in the mesial pit and deep stained fissures elsewhere. What is the most appropriate management?
**A. Preventive resin restoration (PRR)**
B. Class I composite restoration
C. Pit and fissure sealants
D. Class I resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) restoration

**Explanation:**
This question requires precise understanding of restorative terminology.
*   **The Situation:** There is a distinct carious lesion in one part of the occlusal surface (mesial pit), while the rest of the fissure system is sound but at high risk (deep and stained).
*   **Preventive Resin Restoration (PRR):** This is the specific term for the conservative management of this exact scenario. It involves:
    1.  Performing a very small, minimally invasive composite restoration only in the area of the carious lesion (the mesial pit).
    2.  Placing a fissure sealant over the remaining non-carious, at-risk pits and fissures.
*   This approach is both therapeutic (treating the existing decay) and preventive (protecting the rest of the tooth), and is more conservative than preparing the entire occlusal surface for a full Class I restoration.

### Question 165:
A 40-year-old patient with a history of HIV presents with severe gum pain. Examination reveals ulcerated marginal gingiva, generalized recession, and 1-2mm probing depths. What is the diagnosis?
A. Necrotizing gingivitis
**B. Necrotizing periodontitis (NP)**
C. Necrotizing stomatitis
D. Periodontitis

**Explanation:**
The key is to integrate the signs of necrosis with the evidence of attachment loss.
*   **Necrotizing Features:** Severe pain and ulcerated marginal gingiva are hallmark signs of a necrotizing periodontal disease.
*   **Attachment Loss:** The presence of **generalized recession and radiographic bone loss** indicates that attachment loss has occurred.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Because there is attachment loss, it cannot be necrotizing *gingivitis* (which is confined to the gingiva).
    *   Therefore, the diagnosis is **necrotizing periodontitis**.
*   **An Important Feature of NP:** NP is characterized by rapid and severe destruction of the gingival margin. This means that even though there is significant attachment loss (seen as recession), deep pockets do not form because the soft tissue wall of the potential pocket is destroyed. This explains the paradoxical finding of severe attachment loss with shallow probing depths.

### Question 166:
While explaining a procedure, your patient's breathing becomes rapid and shallow, and they experience tingling in their fingers. What is the immediate management?
A. Place the patient in a supine position.
**B. Instruct the patient to breathe into cupped hands.**
C. Administer oxygen.
D. Call 911.

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The signs—rapid, shallow breathing (tachypnea) and tingling in the extremities (paresthesia)—are classic symptoms of **hyperventilation**. This is often triggered by anxiety.
*   **Pathophysiology:** During hyperventilation, the patient rapidly "blows off" too much carbon dioxide, leading to respiratory alkalosis and a drop in blood CO2 levels (hypocapnia).
*   **Management (B):** The goal is to restore the normal CO2 level. Having the patient breathe into their own **cupped hands** (or a paper bag) forces them to re-breathe their exhaled CO2, which corrects the hypocapnia and resolves the symptoms.
*   **Oxygen (C) is contraindicated** as it would do nothing to correct the underlying lack of CO2.

### Question 167:
Which study design is most appropriate for assessing the number of *new* herpes infections that develop in school-aged children over a five-year period?
A. Cross-sectional study
B. Case-control study
**C. Cohort study**
D. Randomized controlled trial

**Explanation:**
The question is asking to measure **incidence**—the rate of *new* cases of a disease over a period of time.
*   **Cohort Study:** This is the ideal design for measuring incidence. A group (cohort) of disease-free individuals is identified at the start and then **followed over time** to see who develops the disease. By tracking the children for five years, you can directly calculate the incidence of new herpes infections.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   **Cross-sectional study** measures **prevalence** (the number of existing cases at a single point in time).
    *   **Case-control study** starts with people who already have the disease (cases) and looks backward in time to identify risk factors.
    *   **Randomized controlled trial** is an experimental design used to test the effectiveness of an intervention, not to observe the natural occurrence of a disease.

### Question 168:
A pregnant patient presents with a red, fleshy, easily-bleeding nodule on her maxillary gingiva. What is the most appropriate periodontal diagnosis?
A. Gingivitis associated with dental biofilm alone
B. Gingivitis mediated by systemic or local factors
**C. Non-dental biofilm-induced gingival disease (Reactive Process)**
D. Necrotizing gingivitis

**Explanation:**
This question tests the 2017 classification system.
*   **The Lesion:** The description is a classic **pyogenic granuloma** (also known as a pregnancy tumor).
*   **The Classification:** A pyogenic granuloma is not a form of gingivitis (which is diffuse inflammation of the gingiva). It is a **reactive process**—an exuberant tissue response to a local irritant (like plaque or calculus), which is hormonally exaggerated during pregnancy.
*   **The Category (C):** Under the 2017 classification, reactive processes like pyogenic granuloma, fibroma, and peripheral giant cell granuloma are categorized as **Non-dental biofilm-induced gingival diseases**.
*   **Important Distinction:** If the pregnant patient had generalized bleeding on probing and inflammation *without* a distinct nodule, the diagnosis would be "Gingivitis mediated by systemic factors (pregnancy)." The question is describing the nodule itself, not generalized gingivitis.

---

### Question 169:
Which of the following occlusal schemes is most likely to result in occlusal wear or attrition?
A. Group function
B. Canine guidance
**C. Bilateral balanced occlusion**
D. Mutually protected occlusion

**Explanation:**
Attrition is wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact. The occlusal scheme with the most contact during function will cause the most wear.
*   **Bilateral Balanced Occlusion:** This scheme, primarily used for complete dentures, is designed to have **maximum tooth contact in all excursive movements**. During lateral and protrusive movements, teeth on both the working and non-working sides remain in contact to stabilize the dentures. This constant, widespread contact leads to the highest potential for attrition.
*   **Canine Guidance / Mutually Protected Occlusion:** In these schemes, all posterior teeth **disocclude** (separate) during excursions, guided by the canines or incisors. This minimizes posterior tooth contact and thus minimizes attrition.
*   **Group Function:** More teeth are in contact than in canine guidance, but there is still no contact on the non-working side, making it less attritive than a fully balanced scheme.

### Question 170:
A patient with facial trauma exhibits difficulty in occlusion and limited mandibular movement. Which finding is most suggestive of a bilateral subcondylar fracture?
**A. Anterior open bite**
B. Posterior open bite
C. Glossoptosis (tongue falling back)
D. Paresthesia of the lower lip

**Explanation:**
A bilateral subcondylar fracture decouples the mandible from its normal hinge points at the base of the skull.
*   **The Mechanism:** With both condylar necks fractured, the strong pull of the elevator muscles of mastication (masseter, medial pterygoid, temporalis) causes the posterior portion of the mandible (the rami) to be displaced **superiorly (upward)**. This causes a shortening of the posterior ramus height.
*   **The Result (A):** As the posterior rami are pulled up, the mandible pivots downward at the front, like a seesaw. This results in the posterior teeth contacting prematurely, while the anterior teeth are left in an **anterior open bite**.
*   **Posterior open bite (B)** is more characteristic of an intracapsular condylar fracture where bleeding into the joint space pushes the ramus downward.

### Question 171:
A master cone fits to the full working length on a radiograph. After obturation, the final radiograph shows the fill is 2mm short. What is the most likely reason?
A. Inaccurate working length determination
B. The master cone is too small
C. The master cone is too large
**D. Bending of the tip of the master cone during obturation**

**Explanation:**
This is a clinical problem-solving question. We must find the error that occurred *between* the cone-fit and the final obturation.
*   **Eliminating Other Options:**
    *   (A) Inaccurate working length is incorrect because the cone *did* fit to the correct length initially.
    *   (B) A cone that is too small would have gone past the apex.
    *   (C) A cone that is too large would not have reached the apex in the first place.
*   **The Correct Reason (D):** The master cone was confirmed to be the correct size and at the correct length. The only logical explanation for it being short in the final fill is an error during the obturation procedure itself. The most common error is accidentally **bending or crimping the delicate apical tip of the gutta-percha cone** against the wall of the access cavity as it is being placed. This tiny bend prevents the cone from seating to its full original depth.

---

### Question 172:
Which of the following conditions will increase the risk of ecchymosis (bruising)?
**A. Chronic alcoholism**
B. Diabetes mellitus
C. Sjogren's syndrome
D. Vitamin D deficiency

**Explanation:**
Ecchymosis is subcutaneous bleeding. It is a sign of a defect in hemostasis, either with platelets or clotting factors.
*   **Chronic Alcoholism:** Chronic heavy alcohol use causes significant **liver damage (cirrhosis)**. The liver is responsible for synthesizing most of the body's clotting factors (e.g., fibrinogen, prothrombin). When the liver is damaged, it cannot produce these factors, leading to a coagulopathy and an increased tendency to bleed and bruise.
*   **Other Options:** Diabetes, Sjogren's, and Vitamin D deficiency are not primarily associated with bleeding disorders. Diabetes is associated with delayed healing.

### Question 173:
An HIV-positive patient is scheduled for a full mouth radiographic series. The clinician decides to double glove. Which ethical principle is being violated?
A. Beneficence
B. Nonmaleficence
**C. Justice**
D. Autonomy

**Explanation:**
This question is about treating all patients with the same standard of care.
*   **Standard/Universal Precautions:** These protocols are designed to be used for **every single patient**, assuming that any patient could have an infectious disease. The standard of care does not require double gloving for routine procedures like taking radiographs.
*   **Justice:** This ethical principle dictates that patients in similar circumstances should be treated fairly and equally. By singling out the HIV-positive patient for an extra, unnecessary precaution (double gloving for a non-surgical procedure), the clinician is treating them differently based on their medical status. This is a form of discrimination and a clear violation of the principle of justice.

### Question 174:
Which of the following is the most important consideration in carrying out a reline of a maxillary and mandibular complete denture?
A. Maintaining undercuts in the denture to retain the impression material.
B. Avoiding removing any acrylic on the fitting surface of the dentures.
C. Removing acrylic from the post-dam area prior to taking the impression.
**D. Taking the impression for both dentures simultaneously while the patient is occluded in centric relation.**

**Explanation:**
The goal of a reline is to improve the fit of the denture base without altering the established occlusion or vertical dimension.
*   **The Problem:** Taking separate impressions for the upper and lower dentures can easily introduce errors and change the occlusal relationship between them.
*   **The Solution (D):** The most accurate method is a **closed-mouth impression technique**. The impression material is placed in both dentures, which are then inserted. The patient is guided to close into their established **centric relation/maximum intercuspation**, and they hold this position while the material sets. This technique functionally relates the upper and lower dentures, ensuring that the existing correct occlusion is preserved in the new relined state.
*   **Other options are incorrect steps:** Undercuts must be removed (A), a thin layer of acrylic must be removed to create space (B), and the post-dam area should not be altered (C).

---

### Question 175:
When 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is used to achieve hemostasis in a direct pulp cap, which of the following takes place?
A. Loss of pulp vitality
**B. A superficial area of sterile necrosis**
C. Tertiary dentin formation
D. Differentiation of odontoblasts

**Explanation:**
NaOCl is an effective hemostatic agent but is also cytotoxic.
*   **The Effect (B):** When applied to the exposed pulp, the low-concentration NaOCl causes a very shallow, controlled chemical "burn" on the surface layer of the pulp tissue. This creates a **superficial area of necrosis**. Because NaOCl is also a powerful disinfectant, this necrotic zone is **sterile**.
*   **The Outcome:** The underlying healthy pulp tissue is then able to heal and repair itself beneath this sterile necrotic layer. The pulp remains vital. The use of a liner like MTA or calcium hydroxide over this area is what then stimulates the differentiation of odontoblasts (D) and subsequent tertiary dentin formation (C). The NaOCl itself only creates the sterile necrotic zone.

### Question 176:
Which of the following best describes a dentist's obligation to treat patients?
A. Dentists must treat every person who requests care.
B. Dentists may deny treatment for any reason.
C. Dentists must treat only those with insurance coverage.
**D. Dentists are obligated to provide emergency care and to avoid discriminatory refusal.**

**Explanation:**
This question addresses the ethical and legal obligations of a dentist.
*   **The Obligation (D):** Dentists have a fundamental obligation to provide **emergency care** to alleviate pain or treat life-threatening conditions for any patient, regardless of their ability to pay at that moment. Furthermore, dentists are obligated to **avoid discriminatory refusal** of care. A dentist cannot refuse to treat a patient based on their race, religion, disability, or medical status (like being HIV-positive).
*   **The Limits:**
    *   (A) Dentists are **not** obligated to treat every person who requests *routine* care. They can refuse a patient for valid reasons (e.g., the patient is abusive, the requested treatment is beyond the dentist's skill level, the patient refuses to pay for services).
    *   (B) Denial of treatment cannot be for "any reason"; it must be for a valid, non-discriminatory reason.
    *   (C) Refusing to treat patients without insurance is a form of discrimination and is unethical.

### Question 177:
A patient presents with a persistent metallic taste. They have amalgam restorations and are currently taking metronidazole. What is the most appropriate management?
A. Replace the amalgam restorations with composite.
B. Polish the amalgam restorations to reduce corrosion.
**C. Advise the patient that the taste alteration is likely drug-related.**
D. Discontinue metronidazole and prescribe another antibiotic.

**Explanation:**
*   **The Culprit:** A **metallic taste** is a well-known and common adverse effect of the antibiotic **metronidazole**.
*   **The Management (C):** The most appropriate first step is to recognize this common side effect and **reassure the patient**. You should advise them that this is a temporary side effect of their medication and will resolve once they finish their course of treatment.
*   **Incorrect Actions:**
    *   (A, B) The amalgam restorations are not the cause. Replacing or polishing them would be unnecessary and inappropriate.
    *   (D) A dentist should **never** advise a patient to discontinue a medication prescribed by their physician for a systemic condition.

---

### Question 178:
Which dental material is most suitable for a crown on a molar in a patient with bruxism?
A. Lithium disilicate
B. Feldspathic porcelain
**C. 3Y Monolithic Zirconia**
D. 5Y Monolithic Zirconia
E. Porcelain-fused-to-zirconia (PFZ)

**Explanation:**
The choice of material for a bruxer must prioritize strength and fracture resistance.
*   **Monolithic Zirconia:** This is the material of choice. "Monolithic" means it is milled from a solid block of zirconia with no weaker porcelain layer on top, making it extremely strong and resistant to fracture.
*   **3Y vs. 5Y Zirconia:** Zirconia is stabilized with yttria.
    *   **3Y Zirconia** (containing 3 mol% yttria) is the strongest but most opaque (least aesthetic) type of zirconia.
    *   **5Y Zirconia** (containing 5 mol% yttria) is more translucent and aesthetic but is significantly weaker than 3Y.
*   **Conclusion (C):** For a molar in a bruxism patient where strength is the absolute priority, **3Y monolithic zirconia** is the most suitable material. A PFZ crown (E) is contraindicated as the porcelain layer would likely chip off.

---

### Question 179:
After placing a rubber dam, the interdental papillae are protruding from beneath the dam. What is the most likely reason?
A. The rubber dam is overstretched by the frame.
B. The holes were punched too far apart.
**C. The holes were punched too close together.**
D. A lightweight rubber dam was used.

**Explanation:**
The spacing of the holes in the rubber dam is critical for proper isolation.
*   **Holes Too Close (C):** If the holes are punched too close to each other, there is not enough rubber dam material between the teeth to properly stretch over the interdental papilla and invert into the sulcus. This lack of material causes the dam to stretch tautly between the teeth, leaving the papilla exposed and protruding from underneath. This also increases the risk of leakage.
*   **Holes Too Far Apart (B):** If the holes are too far apart, there will be excess rubber dam material between the teeth, leading to bunching and wrinkling, which can obstruct access.

---

### Question 180:
What should be considered prior to the application of glass ionomer in a deep cavity close to the pulp?
A. No specific considerations are required.
B. Etch with 37% phosphoric acid.
**C. Apply polyacrylic acid conditioner.**
D. Etch with 10% hydrochloric acid.

**Explanation:**
Glass ionomer (GI) bonds chemically to tooth structure, but the surface must be properly conditioned first.
*   **Smear Layer Removal:** To achieve a strong chemical bond, the smear layer created during cavity preparation must be removed.
*   **Conditioning (C):** The standard conditioner for GI is a weak acid, **10-20% polyacrylic acid**. It is applied for a short time (10-20 seconds) to remove the smear layer without aggressively etching the dentin or opening the dentinal tubules. This cleans the surface and makes it receptive to the chemical bond.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   (B) 37% phosphoric acid is too aggressive. It is used for composite bonding and would over-etch the dentin for a GI application, potentially weakening the bond.
    *   (A) A consideration *is* required: you need to condition the tooth. Furthermore, in a deep cavity close to the pulp, a **liner** (like calcium hydroxide or MTA) should be placed *before* conditioning and placing the GI. The conditioning step itself is still necessary.

### Question 181:
A 62-year-old patient, who is a regular attendee with a few old restorations but no new caries, was recently diagnosed with cancer and started chemotherapy. What is the most appropriate frequency for taking new bitewing radiographs?
A. 6-12 months
**B. 6-18 months**
C. 18-36 months
D. 24-48 months

**Explanation:**
Radiograph frequency is determined by the patient's **caries risk**.
*   **Risk Assessment:** A patient undergoing chemotherapy often experiences xerostomia (dry mouth), which dramatically increases their risk for caries. According to caries risk assessment guidelines, a patient undergoing chemotherapy is automatically considered to be at **high caries risk**.
*   **The Guideline:** The ADA/FDA guidelines for a high-risk adult patient recommend taking bitewing radiographs every **6 to 18 months**.
*   Even though the patient was previously low-risk, their new medical status changes their risk category, and the radiographic recall interval must be adjusted accordingly.

---

### Question 182:
In which environment would you most likely find a microbial profile dominated by gram-negative anaerobic rods and motile spirochetes, particularly from the red and orange complexes?
A. Supragingival biofilm in a patient with generalized gingivitis.
B. Subgingival plaque in a healthy individual.
**C. Periodontal pockets with >5mm probing depths.**
D. Calculus on the lingual surface of mandibular anterior teeth.

**Explanation:**
This question relates to the Socransky microbial complexes and the shift from health to disease.
*   **Health:** Healthy sites are dominated by gram-positive, facultative bacteria (blue and yellow complexes).
*   **Gingivitis:** There is a shift towards a mix of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
*   **Periodontitis (C):** The deep, anaerobic environment of a periodontal pocket (>5mm) is the ideal habitat for the most pathogenic bacteria. This environment is dominated by **gram-negative, anaerobic rods and spirochetes**, which make up the **red and orange complexes** (e.g., *P. gingivalis*, *T. forsythia*, *T. denticola*). These are the bacteria most strongly associated with attachment loss and bone destruction.

### Question 183:
An endodontically treated maxillary first molar is to receive an all-ceramic crown. What is the most appropriate margin design?
A. 0.5mm chamfer margin
**B. 1.0mm shoulder margin**
C. 1.0mm feather edge margin
D. 1.5mm shoulder margin

**Explanation:**
Margin design is dictated by the material requirements for strength and aesthetics.
*   **All-Ceramic Crowns:** Materials like lithium disilicate or zirconia require a certain bulk of material at the margin to resist fracture. They cannot be thinned to a knife-edge.
*   **The Guideline (B):** The standard recommendation for an all-ceramic crown is a **shoulder margin** (or a deep chamfer, which is functionally similar) with a width of approximately **1.0 mm**. This provides adequate support for the ceramic material.
*   **Incorrect Options:**
    *   (A) 0.5mm is for full metal crowns.
    *   (C) Feather edge is for metal crowns only.
    *   (D) 1.5mm is the requirement for a porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crown, which needs more space to accommodate both the metal coping and the overlying porcelain.

---

### Question 184:
What is the most appropriate management of a tissue-colored overgrowth on the buccal mucosa that bothers the patient when they eat?
A. Incisional biopsy
**B. Excisional biopsy**
C. Topical antifungals
D. Observe and monitor

**Explanation:**
*   **Diagnosis:** The description (tissue-colored, history of being bitten) is a classic presentation of a **traumatic fibroma** or irritation fibroma. This is a benign, reactive lesion.
*   **Management (B):** The definitive treatment for a benign, localized lesion like a fibroma is **excisional biopsy**. This means the entire lesion is surgically removed and then sent for histopathologic examination to confirm the diagnosis.
*   **Incisional vs. Excisional:** An incisional biopsy (removing only a piece of the lesion) is reserved for large lesions or lesions that are suspected of being malignant. For a small, clearly benign lesion, complete excision is both diagnostic and therapeutic.

---

### Question 185:
A free gingival graft (FGG) procedure is contraindicated in which case?
A. Mid-buccal recession on tooth #16.
B. An implant at #46 with only 2mm of keratinized tissue.
**C. A previously treated periodontitis patient with generalized interproximal and palatal 4mm recession.**
D. Recession on a mandibular incisor in a patient with a history of aggressive tooth brushing.

**Explanation:**
The primary goal of a free gingival graft is to increase the zone of attached/keratinized tissue. While it can achieve some root coverage, its success is highly dependent on the blood supply and the type of defect.
*   **The Contraindication (C):** A patient with **generalized interproximal recession** falls into Miller Class III or IV. In these cases, the blood supply from the interdental papillae has been compromised, and it is impossible to achieve complete root coverage. An FGG would have a very poor and unpredictable outcome for root coverage in such a widespread, advanced defect.
*   **The Indications (A, B, D):**
    *   (A, D) An FGG can be used to treat localized mid-buccal recession, especially in non-aesthetic areas like the mandibular incisors or maxillary molars.
    *   (B) This is a classic indication for an FGG: to increase the width of keratinized tissue around an implant to prevent future recession.

### Question 186:
A 12-year-old female has a Class II malocclusion due to a retrognathic mandible (SNA 82, SNB 74). What is the best time to initiate interceptive orthodontic treatment?
**A. It should be initiated immediately.**
B. It should be initiated in 9-12 months when all permanent teeth have erupted.
C. It should be initiated after growth is complete.
D. It should have been initiated in the early mixed dentition.

**Explanation:**
The timing of growth modification depends on the type of malocclusion.
*   **The Malocclusion:** This is a **Class II malocclusion** caused by a deficient mandible. The treatment goal is to use a functional appliance (like a Twin Block or Herbst) to encourage forward mandibular growth.
*   **The Timing:** Treatment for Class II malocclusions is most effective when timed to coincide with the patient's **pre-pubertal growth spurt**. A 12-year-old female is typically in the late mixed dentition and entering this peak growth period.
*   **Conclusion (A):** Therefore, treatment should be initiated **immediately** to take full advantage of this growth potential. Waiting until all permanent teeth have erupted (B) or until growth is complete (C) would miss the window for effective orthopedic correction. Early mixed dentition (D) is the ideal timing for Class III treatment, not Class II.

### Question 187:
A 39-year-old patient reports recent anxiety, a feeling of her heart beating fast (palpitations), and weight loss. Which condition is suspected?
A. Hypothyroidism
**B. Hyperthyroidism**
C. Cushing's syndrome
D. Addison's disease

**Explanation:**
*   **The Symptoms:** Anxiety, palpitations, and weight loss are classic signs of an **overactive metabolic state**.
*   **Hyperthyroidism:** This condition is caused by an excess of thyroid hormone, which acts as the body's accelerator. It speeds up metabolism, leading to symptoms like weight loss (despite increased appetite), heat intolerance, nervousness/anxiety, and tachycardia/palpitations.
*   **Hypothyroidism** would cause the opposite: weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, and bradycardia.

### Question 188:
Which of the following explains the mechanism of action of caries detecting dyes?
A. Caries detecting dyes stain infected dentin only.
B. Caries detecting dyes stain affected dentin only.
**C. Caries detecting dyes stain demineralized dentin.**
D. Caries detecting dyes stain infected and affected dentin only.

**Explanation:**
Caries detecting dyes are not as specific as their name implies.
*   **The Mechanism (C):** These dyes do not specifically stain bacteria. They bind to and stain the **porous, demineralized collagen matrix** of dentin.
*   **The Problem:** Both **infected dentin** (which is full of bacteria and must be removed) and **affected dentin** (which is demineralized but sterile and remineralizable, and should be preserved) are demineralized.
*   **The Clinical Consequence:** Because the dye stains both infected and affected dentin, relying on it to guide excavation leads to the **over-removal of tooth structure**, as the clinician will remove the sound but stained affected dentin. For this reason, their use is generally no longer recommended.

### Question 189:
A patient is taking lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Which is the least appropriate analgesic to prescribe?
**A. Ibuprofen**
B. Naproxen
C. Acetaminophen
D. Acetaminophen with codeine

**Explanation:**
This question is about the interaction between NSAIDs and certain antihypertensive medications.
*   **The Interaction:** NSAIDs can interfere with the production of prostaglandins, which play a role in regulating renal blood flow and sodium excretion. This interference can **reduce the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs**, particularly ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, potentially leading to an increase in blood pressure.
*   **NSAID Differences:** While all NSAIDs can have this effect, studies have shown that **ibuprofen** has a more pronounced interaction than **naproxen**. Therefore, if an NSAID must be used in a hypertensive patient, naproxen is considered a relatively safer choice.
*   **Conclusion (A):** Ibuprofen is the **least appropriate** choice among the NSAIDs. Acetaminophen (C, D) does not have this interaction and is a safe alternative for pain relief in these patients.

### Question 190:
A patient with missing mandibular molars bilaterally requires an RPD. Which indirect retainer location would be the most appropriate?
A. Distal occlusal rest on tooth #45
B. Mesial occlusal rest on tooth #35
**C. Cingulum rest on tooth #33**
D. Distal occlusal rest on tooth #44

**Explanation:**
An indirect retainer is a component (usually a rest) designed to counteract the lifting forces on a distal extension base.
*   **The Rule:** To be most effective, the indirect retainer must be placed on the opposite side of the fulcrum line from the distal extension and **as far away from the fulcrum line as possible**.
*   **The Fulcrum Line:** In a bilateral distal extension case (Kennedy Class I), the fulcrum line connects the most posterior rests on the terminal abutment teeth (e.g., #34 and #44).
*   **The Location (C):** To get as far anteriorly as possible from this fulcrum line, the ideal location for an indirect retainer is a **cingulum rest on a canine** (like tooth #33). Placing a rest on a premolar (A, B, D) would be too close to the fulcrum line and would not provide effective leverage against the rotational forces.

### Question 191:
A 4-year-old patient is at high risk of developing caries. Which of these factors puts them at high risk?
A. Living in an area with no fluoride in the water supply.
B. Attending the dental clinic for a checkup twice a year.
**C. Having two incipient carious lesions in the primary molars.**
D. Having visible plaque on the teeth.

**Explanation:**
This question uses the criteria from a standard Caries Risk Assessment form.
*   **High-Risk Factor (C):** The presence of **any new carious lesions** within the last 24-36 months is a primary indicator that classifies a patient as **high risk**. The two incipient lesions meet this criterion.
*   **Moderate-Risk Factors (A, D):**
    *   Insufficient fluoride exposure (non-fluoridated water) is a **moderate** risk factor.
    *   Visible plaque is a **moderate** risk factor.
*   **Low-Risk Factor (B):** Having a regular "dental home" is a protective, low-risk factor.
*   Even though the patient has moderate risk factors, the presence of a single high-risk factor automatically places them in the high-risk category.

### Question 192:
A 10-year-old patient experienced a complicated crown fracture of tooth #11 *the previous day*. What is the most appropriate management?
A. Direct pulp capping
**B. Partial pulpotomy (Cvek pulpotomy)**
C. Cervical pulpotomy
D. Apexification

**Explanation:**
This question tests the management of traumatic pulp exposures based on the **size and age** of the exposure.
*   **Diagnosis:** "Complicated crown fracture" means there is pulp exposure. "The previous day" means the exposure is **more than 24 hours old**.
*   **The Guideline:**
    *   **Direct Pulp Cap:** Is only indicated for *recent* (less than 24 hours) and *pinpoint* exposures.
    *   **Partial Pulpotomy:** Is indicated for larger exposures or for exposures that are **older than 24 hours**. The procedure involves removing the superficial 1-2mm of inflamed pulp tissue to reach healthy tissue before placing a capping material.
*   **Conclusion (B):** Because the exposure occurred "the previous day," it is no longer considered recent. Therefore, a **partial pulpotomy** is the indicated treatment to remove the superficially contaminated pulp tissue, regardless of the size of the exposure or the status of the apex (open vs. closed).

### Question 193:
A patient complains of a gummy smile. Their incisors are short, and radiographs show the alveolar bone is at the level of the CEJ. What is the most appropriate management?
A. Application of porcelain veneers
**B. Crown lengthening**
C. Orthodontic extrusion
D. Connective tissue graft

**Explanation:**
*   **The Diagnosis:** The finding of the alveolar bone crest being at the same level as the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) is the key. This is the diagnosis of **altered passive eruption**. Normally, the bone should be 1-2mm apical to the CEJ. Because the bone is too high, the gingiva is also too high, covering part of the anatomical crown and making the teeth appear short.
*   **The Treatment (B):** The only way to correct this is to surgically move the bone and gingiva to their correct apical position. This procedure is called **crown lengthening**, which involves raising a flap, performing an ostectomy (removing supporting bone) to re-establish the correct distance between the bone crest and the CEJ, and then apically repositioning the flap.
*   **Incorrect Options:** Veneers (A) or orthodontic extrusion (C) would make the teeth appear longer but would not correct the underlying problem of the high gingival levels, thus failing to treat the "gummy smile."

### Question 194:
For a complete denture case, grooves are placed on the labial/buccal surfaces of the wax rims. What is the purpose of these grooves?
A. To lock the maxillary rim against the mandibular rim.
B. To prevent posterior interferences during mounting.
**C. To provide a repeatable position in vertical and horizontal planes.**
D. To guide the placement of the anterior teeth.

**Explanation:**
These grooves are part of a technique for verifying the centric relation (CR) record.
*   **The Technique:** After an initial CR record is made, V-shaped grooves are cut into the maxillary wax rim. The patient is asked to close repeatedly into the CR position.
*   **The Purpose (C):** Each time the patient closes correctly, the pointed cusps of the mandibular wax rim should fit perfectly and repeatedly into the V-shaped grooves of the maxillary rim. This provides a **visual check** to confirm that the recorded centric relation position is **accurate and repeatable** both vertically and horizontally. If the rims meet differently each time, the CR record is not reliable. Notches (A) are used to lock the rims together once the record is made.

### Question 195:
All of the following classes of drugs are useful in improving the secretion of saliva EXCEPT:
**A. Muscarinic antagonists**
B. Muscarinic agonists
C. Cholinesterase inhibitors (Anticholinesterases)
D. Parasympathomimetics

**Explanation:**
Saliva secretion is primarily under the control of the **parasympathetic nervous system**, which uses **acetylcholine** acting on **muscarinic receptors**. Any drug that enhances this pathway will increase salivation.
*   **Muscarinic Antagonists (A):** These drugs (like atropine, scopolamine) **block** the muscarinic receptors. By blocking the action of acetylcholine, they **inhibit** parasympathetic activity, leading to xerostomia (dry mouth). This is the correct "except" answer.
*   **The Sialogogues (B, C, D):**
    *   **Muscarinic agonists** (e.g., pilocarpine, cevimeline) directly stimulate the receptors, increasing salivation.
    *   **Cholinesterase inhibitors** prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, increasing its availability to stimulate the receptors.
    *   **Parasympathomimetics** is a general term for drugs that mimic or enhance the parasympathetic system.

### Question 196:
Which instrumentation technique is most appropriate for use with rotary endodontic systems?
A. Step-back technique
**B. Crown-down technique**
C. Watch-winding technique
D. Balanced force technique

**Explanation:**
*   **Rotary Systems:** Rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) files are designed to be used in a specific manner to maximize their efficiency and safety.
*   **Crown-Down Technique (B):** This is the standard technique for rotary instrumentation. The clinician starts by shaping the coronal and middle thirds of the canal with larger files first, and then progresses apically with smaller files.
*   **Advantages:** This approach removes coronal interferences early, reduces stress on the file tips, allows for better irrigant penetration, and minimizes the extrusion of debris beyond the apex.
*   **Other options (A, C, D)** are techniques developed for and used with manual, stainless steel hand files.

### Question 197:
A patient develops a fluctuant abscess adjacent to a surgical site a few days after a crown lengthening procedure. What is the most likely reason?
A. Failure of the crown lengthening procedure.
B. Failure of the endodontic treatment.
**C. Accumulation of debris under the periosteum during the crown lengthening procedure.**
D. Suturing the gingival tissues under tension.

**Explanation:**
*   **The Procedure:** Crown lengthening involves raising a **full-thickness flap** and removing bone with a bur.
*   **The Complication:** This process creates bone and tooth debris. If the surgical site is not **thoroughly irrigated with saline** before the flap is sutured back into place, this debris can get trapped under the flap.
*   **The Result (C):** This trapped debris acts as a foreign body, leading to an inflammatory response and the formation of a **subperiosteal abscess**.
*   **Incorrect Options:** "Failure" of the procedure (A) would mean the bone wasn't removed, which wouldn't cause an abscess. Suturing under tension (D) leads to flap dehiscence or necrosis, not an abscess.

### Question 198:
Which of the following is the most appropriate for *polishing* composite restorations?
A. Finishing diamond burs
**B. Aluminum oxide discs**
C. Carbide burs
D. Polishing stones

**Explanation:**
There is a distinction between finishing (gross contouring and smoothing) and polishing (creating a high-luster, shiny surface).
*   **Polishing (B):** The final high-gloss polish on a composite is best achieved with a sequence of flexible discs impregnated with abrasive particles. The most common are **aluminum oxide discs** (e.g., Sof-Lex discs), which come in a series of grits from coarse to superfine. The final steps with the fine and superfine discs create the polish. Rubber points and polishing pastes can also be used.
*   **Finishing (A, C):** Diamond and carbide burs, even the fine-grit "finishing" burs, are used for initial contouring, shaping, and removing excess material. They smooth the restoration but do not create the final high polish.
*   **Polishing Stones (D):** These are typically used for polishing metals or porcelain, not composites.

### Question 199:
A 40-year-old patient has poor oral hygiene, good salivary flow, and three Class II composite restorations placed five years ago. They are taking hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. What is the patient's caries risk?
A. Low
**B. Moderate**
C. High
D. Extreme

**Explanation:**
This requires summing the risk factors from a standard caries risk assessment form.
*   **Risk Factors Present:**
    1.  **Poor oral hygiene/Visible plaque:** This is a **moderate** risk factor.
    2.  **Three existing interproximal restorations:** Having multiple interproximal restorations is a **moderate** risk factor.
    3.  **Taking hydrochlorothiazide:** This medication is known to cause xerostomia. Even though the patient currently has "good salivary flow," the use of a potentially xerostomic medication is considered a **moderate** risk factor.
*   **Protective/Low-Risk Factors:**
    1.  **No new restorations in the last 36 months:** The restorations were placed 5 years ago. This is a low-risk factor.
*   **Conclusion (B):** The patient has multiple **moderate** risk factors and no high-risk factors. Therefore, their overall caries risk is categorized as **moderate**.

### Question 200:
Examination of a tooth shows destruction of tooth structure that can be easily detected with a probe. Probing the deepest part reveals soft dentin. What is the ICDAS classification and activity of this carious lesion?
A. Moderate caries, active
B. Moderate caries, arrested
**C. Extensive caries, active**
D. Extensive caries, arrested

**Explanation:**
This question tests the definitions of the ICDAS caries classification system.
*   **Activity:** The dentin is described as **"soft"** upon probing. Soft, leathery dentin is the clinical sign of an **active** carious lesion. Hard, shiny dentin would indicate an arrested lesion.
*   **Severity:**
    *   **ICDAS 3 & 4 (Moderate):** Involve a shadow in the dentin or a micro-cavitation in enamel, but the dentin itself is **not clinically exposed**.
    *   **ICDAS 5 & 6 (Extensive):** Are defined by a distinct cavity with **visible, exposed dentin**.
*   **Conclusion (C):** Since the probe is touching soft dentin at the base of the cavity, the dentin is clearly exposed. This means the lesion must be at least a code 5 or 6, which falls under the category of **extensive caries**. Combined with the soft texture, the diagnosis is **extensive caries, active**.
